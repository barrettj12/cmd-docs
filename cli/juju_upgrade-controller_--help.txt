Details:
This command upgrades the Juju agent for a controller.

A controller's agent version can be shown with `juju model-config -m controller agent-
version`.
A version is denoted by: major.minor.patch

You can upgrade the controller to a new patch version by specifying
the '--agent-version' flag. If not specified, the upgrade candidate
will default to the most recent patch version matching the current 
major and minor version. Upgrading to a new major or minor version is
not supported.

The command will abort if an upgrade is in progress. It will also abort if
a previous upgrade was not fully completed (e.g.: if one of the
controllers in a high availability model failed to upgrade).

Examples:

    juju upgrade-controller --dry-run
    juju upgrade-controller --agent-version 2.0.1
