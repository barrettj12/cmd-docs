    Rush through machine removal without waiting for each individual step to complete

Details:
Machines are specified by their numbers, which may be retrieved from the
output of `juju status`.

It is possible to remove machine from Juju model without affecting
the corresponding cloud instance by using --keep-instance option.

Machines responsible for the model cannot be removed.

Machines running units or containers can be removed using the '--force'
option; this will also remove those units and containers without giving
them an opportunity to shut down cleanly.

Machine removal is a multi-step process. Under normal circumstances, Juju will not
proceed to the next step until the current step has finished. 
However, when using --force, users can also specify --no-wait to progress through steps 
without delay waiting for each step to complete.

Examples:

    juju remove-machine 5
    juju remove-machine 6 --force
    juju remove-machine 6 --force --no-wait
    juju remove-machine 7 --keep-instance
