Details:
This command updates a resource for an application.

For file resources, it uploads a file from your local disk to the juju controller to be
streamed to the charm when "resource-get" is called by a hook.

For OCI image resources used by k8s applications, an OCI image or file path is specified.
A file is specified when a private OCI image is needed and the username/password used to
access the image is needed along with the image path.
