Details:
This command requests that Juju creates a backup of its state.
You may provide a note to associate with the backup.

By default, the backup archive and associated metadata are downloaded.

Use --no-download to avoid getting a local copy of the backup downloaded 
at the end of the backup process. In this case it is recommended that the
model config attribute "backup-dir" be set to point to a path where the
backup archives should be stored long term. This could be a remotely mounted
filesystem; the same path must exist on each controller if using HA.

Use --verbose to see extra information about backup.

To access remote backups stored on the controller, see 'juju download-backup'.

Examples:

    juju create-backup 
    juju create-backup --no-download
