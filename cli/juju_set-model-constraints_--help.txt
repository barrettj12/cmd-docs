Details:
Sets constraints on the model that can be viewed with
`juju model-constraints`.  By default, the model is the current model.
Model constraints are combined with constraints set for an application with
`juju set-constraints` for commands (such as 'deploy') that provision
machines/containers for applications. Where model and application constraints overlap, the
application constraints take precedence.
Constraints for a specific application can be viewed with `juju constraints`.

Examples:

    juju set-model-constraints cores=8 mem=16G
    juju set-model-constraints -m mymodel root-disk=64G
