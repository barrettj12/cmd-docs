# ADD-CLOUD
> See also: [clouds](#clouds), [update-cloud](#update-cloud), [remove-cloud](#remove-cloud), [update-credential](#update-credential)

## Summary
Add a cloud definition to Juju.

## Usage
```juju add-cloud [options] <cloud name> [<cloud definition file>]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--client` | false | Client operation |
| `--credential` |  | Credential to use for new cloud |
| `--f`, `--file` |  | The path to a cloud definition file |
| `--force` | false | Force add cloud to the controller |

## Examples

    juju add-cloud
    juju add-cloud --force
    juju add-cloud mycloud ~/mycloud.yaml
    juju add-cloud --controller mycontroller mycloud 
    juju add-cloud --controller mycontroller mycloud --credential mycred
    juju add-cloud --client mycloud ~/mycloud.yaml


## Details

Juju needs to know how to connect to clouds. A cloud definition 
describes a cloud's endpoints and authentication requirements. Each
definition is stored and accessed later as &lt;cloud name&gt;.

If you are accessing a public cloud, running add-cloud is unlikely to be 
necessary.  Juju already contains definitions for the public cloud 
providers it supports.

add-cloud operates in two modes:

    juju add-cloud
    juju add-cloud <cloud name> <cloud definition file>

When invoked without arguments, add-cloud begins an interactive session
designed for working with private clouds.  The session will enable you 
to instruct Juju how to connect to your private cloud.

A cloud definition can be provided in a file either as an option -f or as a 
positional argument:

    juju add-cloud mycloud ~/mycloud.yaml
    juju add-cloud mycloud -f ~/mycloud.yaml

When &lt;cloud definition file&gt; is provided with &lt;cloud name&gt;,
Juju will validate the content of the file and add this cloud 
to this client as well as upload it to a controller.

Use --controller option to upload a cloud to a controller. 

Use --client option to add cloud to the current client.

A cloud definition file has the following YAML format:

    clouds:                           # mandatory
      mycloud:                        # <cloud name> argument
        type: openstack               # <cloud type>, see below
        auth-types: [ userpass ]
        regions:
          london:
            endpoint: https://london.mycloud.com:35574/v3.0/

Cloud types for private clouds: 
 - lxd
 - maas
 - manual
 - openstack
 - vsphere

Cloud types for public clouds:
 - azure
 - ec2
 - gce
 - oci

When a running controller is updated, the credential for the cloud
is also uploaded. As with the cloud, the credential needs
to have been added to the current client, use add-credential to
do that. If there's only one credential for the cloud it will be
uploaded to the controller automatically by add-cloud command. 
However, if the cloud has multiple credentials on this client
you can specify which to upload with the --credential option.

When adding clouds to a controller, some clouds are whitelisted and can be easily added:
 - controller cloud type "kubernetes" supports [lxd maas openstack]
 - controller cloud type "lxd" supports [lxd maas openstack]
 - controller cloud type "maas" supports [maas openstack]
 - controller cloud type "openstack" supports [openstack]

Other cloud combinations can only be force added as the user must consider
network routability, etc - concerns that are outside of scope of Juju.
When forced addition is desired, use --force.

# ADD-CREDENTIAL
> See also: [credentials](#credentials), [remove-credential](#remove-credential), [update-credential](#update-credential), [default-credential](#default-credential), [default-region](#default-region), [autoload-credentials](#autoload-credentials)

## Summary
Adds a credential for a cloud to a local client and uploads it to a controller.

## Usage
```juju add-credential [options] <cloud name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--client` | false | Client operation |
| `--f`, `--file` |  | The YAML file containing credentials to add |
| `--region` |  | Cloud region that credential is valid for |

## Examples

    juju add-credential google
    juju add-credential google --client
    juju add-credential google -c mycontroller
    juju add-credential aws -f ~/credentials.yaml -c mycontroller
    juju add-credential aws -f ~/credentials.yaml
    juju add-credential aws -f ~/credentials.yaml --client


## Details

The juju add-credential command operates in two modes.

When called with only the &lt;cloud name&gt; argument, `juju add-credential` will 
take you through an interactive prompt to add a credential specific to 
the cloud provider.

Providing the `-f <credentials.yaml>` option switches to the 
non-interactive mode. &lt;credentials.yaml&gt; must be a path to a correctly 
formatted YAML-formatted file. 

Sample yaml file shows five credentials being stored against four clouds:

    credentials:
      aws:
        <credential-name>:
          auth-type: access-key
          access-key: <key>
          secret-key: <key>
      azure:
        <credential-name>:
          auth-type: service-principal-secret
          application-id: <uuid>
          application-password: <password>
          subscription-id: <uuid>
      lxd:
        <credential-a>:
          auth-type: interactive
          trust-password: <password>
        <credential-b>:
          auth-type: interactive
          trust-password: <password>
      google:
        <credential-name>:
          auth-type: oauth2
          project-id: <project-id>
          private-key: <private-key>
          client-email: <email>
          client-id: <client-id>

The &lt;credential-name&gt; parameter of each credential is arbitrary, but must
be unique within each &lt;cloud-name&gt;. This allows each cloud to store 
multiple credentials.

The format for a credential is cloud-specific. Thus, it's best to use
'add-credential' command in an interactive mode. This will result in
adding this new credential locally and / or uploading it to a controller 
in a correct format for the desired cloud.


Notes:
If you are setting up Juju for the first time, consider running
`juju autoload-credentials`. This may allow you to skip adding 
credentials manually.

This command does not set default regions nor default credentials for the
cloud. The commands `juju default-region` and `juju default-credential`
provide that functionality.

Use --controller option to upload a credential to a controller. 

Use --client option to add a credential to the current client.

instructions.

# ADD-K8S
> See also: [remove-k8s](#remove-k8s)

## Summary
Adds a k8s endpoint and credential to Juju.

## Usage
```juju add-k8s [options] <k8s name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--client` | false | Client operation |
| `--cloud` |  | k8s cluster cloud |
| `--cluster-name` |  | Specify the k8s cluster to import |
| `--context-name` |  | Specify the k8s context to import |
| `--credential` |  | the credential to use when accessing the cluster |
| `--region` |  | k8s cluster region or cloud/region |
| `--skip-storage` | false | used when adding a cluster that doesn't have storage |
| `--storage` |  | k8s storage class for workload storage |

## Examples

When your kubeconfig file is in the default location:

    juju add-k8s myk8scloud
    juju add-k8s myk8scloud --client
    juju add-k8s myk8scloud --controller mycontroller
    juju add-k8s --context-name mycontext myk8scloud
    juju add-k8s myk8scloud --region cloudNameOrCloudType/someregion
    juju add-k8s myk8scloud --cloud cloudNameOrCloudType
    juju add-k8s myk8scloud --cloud cloudNameOrCloudType --region=someregion
    juju add-k8s myk8scloud --cloud cloudNameOrCloudType --storage mystorageclass
    
To add a Kubernetes cloud using data from your kubeconfig file, when this file is not in the default location:

    KUBECONFIG=path-to-kubeconfig-file juju add-k8s myk8scloud --cluster-name=my_cluster_name
    
To add a Kubernetes cloud using data from kubectl, when your kubeconfig file is not in the default location:

    kubectl config view --raw | juju add-k8s myk8scloud --cluster-name=my_cluster_name



## Details

Creates a user-defined cloud based on a k8s cluster.

The new k8s cloud can then be used to bootstrap into, or it
can be added to an existing controller.

Use --controller option to add k8s cloud to a controller.
Use --client option to add k8s cloud to this client.

Specify a non default kubeconfig file location using $KUBECONFIG
environment variable or pipe in file content from stdin.

The config file can contain definitions for different k8s clusters,
use --cluster-name to pick which one to use.
It's also possible to select a context by name using --context-name.

When running add-k8s the underlying cloud/region hosting the cluster needs to be
detected to enable storage to be correctly configured. If the cloud/region cannot
be detected automatically, use either
  --cloud &lt;cloudType&#x7c;cloudName&gt; to specify the host cloud
or
  --region &lt;cloudType&#x7c;cloudName&gt;/&lt;someregion&gt; to specify the host
  cloud type and region.

Region is strictly necessary only when adding a k8s cluster to a JAAS controller.
When using a standalone Juju controller, usually just --cloud is required.

Once Juju is aware of the underlying cloud type, it looks for a suitably configured
storage class to provide operator and workload storage. If none is found, use
of the --storage option is required so that Juju will create a storage class
with the specified name.

If the cluster does not have a storage provisioning capability, use the
--skip-storage option to add the cluster without any workload storage configured.

## Examples

Start a new machine by requesting one from the cloud provider:

	juju add-machine
	
Start 2 new machines:

	juju add-machine -n 2
	
Start a LXD container on a new machine instance and add both as machines:

	juju add-machine lxd

Start two machine instances, each hosting a LXD container, then add all four as machines:

	juju add-machine lxd -n 2
	
Create a container on machine 4 and add it as a machine:

	juju add-machine lxd:4
	
Start a new machine and require that it has 8GB RAM:

	juju add-machine --constraints mem=8G
	
Start a new machine within the "us-east-1a" availability zone:

	juju add-machine --constraints zones=us-east-1a
	
Start a new machine with at least 4 CPU cores and 16GB RAM, and request three storage volumes to be attached to it. Two are large capacity (1TB) HDD and one is a lower capacity (100GB) SSD. Note: 'ebs' and 'ebs-ssd' are storage pools specific to AWS.

	juju add-machine --constraints="cores=4 mem=16G" --disks="ebs,1T,2 ebs-ssd,100G,1"
	
Allocate a machine to the model via SSH:

	juju add-machine ssh:user@10.10.0.3
	
Allocate a machine specifying the private key to use during the connection:

	juju add-machine ssh:user@10.10.0.3 --private-key /tmp/id_rsa
	
Allocate a machine specifying a public key to set in the list of authorized keys in the machine:

	juju add-machine ssh:user@10.10.0.3 --public-key /tmp/id_rsa.pub
	
Allocate a machine specifying a public key to set in the list of authorized keys and the private key to used during the connection:

	juju add-machine ssh:user@10.10.0.3 --public-key /tmp/id_rsa.pub --private-key /tmp/id_rsa
	
Allocate a machine to the model. Note: specific to MAAS.

	juju add-machine host.internal


## Details

Add a new machine to the model. The command operates in three modes,
depending on the options provided:

  - provision a new machine from the cloud (default, see "Provisioning
    a new machine")
  - create an operating system container (see "Container creation")
  - connect to a live computer and allocate it as a machine (see "Manual 
    provisioning")

The add-machine command is unavailable in k8s clouds. Provisioning
a new machine is unavailable on the manual cloud provider. 

Once the add-machine command has finished, the machine's ID can be 
used as a placement directive for deploying applications. Machine IDs 
are also accessible via 'juju status' and 'juju machines'.


Provisioning a new machine

When add-machine is called without arguments, Juju provisions a new 
machine instance from the current cloud. The machine's specifications, 
including whether the machine is virtual or physical depends on the cloud.

To control which instance type is provisioned, use the --constraints and 
--base options. --base can be specified using the OS name and the version of
the OS, separated by @. For example, --base ubuntu@22.04.

To add storage volumes to the instance, provide a whitespace-delimited
list of storage constraints to the --disks option. 

Add "placement directives" as an argument give Juju additional information 
about how to allocate the machine in the cloud. For example, one can direct 
the MAAS provider to acquire a particular node by specifying its hostname.


Manual provisioning

Call add-machine with the address of a network-accessible computer to 
allocate that machine to the model.

Manual provisioning is the process of installing Juju on an existing machine
and bringing it under Juju's management. The Juju controller must be able to
access the new machine over the network.


Container creation

If a operating system container type is specified (e.g. "lxd" or "kvm"), 
then add-machine will allocate a container of that type on a new machine 
instance. Both the new instance, and the new container will be available 
as machines in the model.

It is also possible to add containers to existing machines using the format
&lt;container-type&gt;:&lt;machine-id&gt;. Constraints cannot be combined this mode.

| `--config` |  | Path to YAML model configuration file or individual options (--config config.yaml [--config key=value ...]) |
| `--credential` |  | Credential used to add the model |
| `--no-switch` | false | Do not switch to the newly created model |
| `--owner` |  | The owner of the new model if not the current user |

## Examples

    juju add-model mymodel
    juju add-model mymodel us-east-1
    juju add-model mymodel aws/us-east-1
    juju add-model mymodel --config my-config.yaml --config image-stream=daily
    juju add-model mymodel --credential credential_name --config authorized-keys="ssh-rsa ..."


## Details
Adding a model is typically done in order to run a specific workload.

To add a model, you must specify a model name. Model names can be duplicated
across controllers but must be unique per user for any given controller.
In other words, Alice and Bob can each have their own model called "secret" but
Alice can have only one model called "secret" in a controller.
Model names may only contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, and
may not start with a hyphen.

To add a model, Juju requires a credential:
* if you have a default (or just one) credential defined at client
  (i.e. in credentials.yaml), then juju will use that;
* if you have no default (and multiple) credentials defined at the client,
  then you must specify one using --credential;
* as the admin user you can omit the credential,
  and the credential used to bootstrap will be used.

To add a credential for add-model, use one of the "juju add-credential" or
"juju autoload-credentials" commands. These will add credentials
to the Juju client, which "juju add-model" will upload to the controller
as necessary.

You may also supply model-specific configuration as well as a
cloud/region to which this model will be deployed. The cloud/region and credentials
are the ones used to create any future resources within the model.

If no cloud/region is specified, then the model will be deployed to
the same cloud/region as the controller model. If a region is specified
without a cloud qualifier, then it is assumed to be in the same cloud
as the controller model.

When adding --config, the default-series key is deprecated in favour of
default-base, e.g. ubuntu@22.04.

    juju add-storage gluster/0 brick=ebs-ssd


Further reading:

https://juju.is/docs/storage


## Details

Add storage to a pre-existing unit within a model. Storage is allocated from 
a storage pool, using parameters provided within a "storage directive". (Use 
'juju deploy --storage=&lt;storage-directive&gt;' to provision storage during the 
deployment process).

	juju add-storage &lt;unit&gt; &lt;storage-directive&gt;

&lt;unit&gt; is the ID of a unit that is already in the model. 

&lt;storage-directive&gt; describes to the charm how to refer to the storage, 
and where to provision it from. &lt;storage-directive&gt; takes the following form:
	
    <storage-name>[=<storage-constraint>]

&lt;storage-name&gt; is defined in the charm's metadata.yaml file.   

&lt;storage-constraint&gt; is a description of how Juju should provision storage 
instances for the unit. The following three forms are accepted:

    <storage-pool>[,<count>][,<size>]
    <count>[,<size>]
    <size>

&lt;storage-pool&gt; is the storage pool to provision storage instances from. Must 
be a name from 'juju storage-pools'.  The default pool is available via 
executing 'juju model-config storage-default-block-source'.

&lt;count&gt; is the number of storage instances to provision from &lt;storage-pool&gt; of
&lt;size&gt;. Must be a positive integer. The default count is "1". May be restricted
by the charm, which can specify a maximum number of storage instances per unit.

&lt;size&gt; is the number of bytes to provision per storage instance. Must be a 
positive number, followed by a size suffix.  Valid suffixes include M, G, T,
and P.  Defaults to "1024M", or the which can specify a minimum size required 
by the charm.

# ADD-UNIT
> See also: [remove-unit](#remove-unit)

## Summary
Adds one or more units to a deployed application.

## Usage
```juju add-unit [options] <application name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--attach-storage` |  | Existing storage to attach to the deployed unit (not available on k8s models) |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |
| `--n`, `--num-units` | 1 | Number of units to add |
| `--to` |  | The machine and/or container to deploy the unit in (bypasses constraints) |

## Examples

Add five units of mysql on five new machines:

    juju add-unit mysql -n 5

Add a unit of mysql to machine 23 (which already exists):

    juju add-unit mysql --to 23

Add two units of mysql to existing machines 3 and 4:

   juju add-unit mysql -n 2 --to 3,4

Add three units of mysql, one to machine 3 and the others to new
machines:

    juju add-unit mysql -n 3 --to 3

Add a unit of mysql into a new LXD container on machine 7:

    juju add-unit mysql --to lxd:7

Add two units of mysql into two new LXD containers on machine 7:

    juju add-unit mysql -n 2 --to lxd:7,lxd:7

Add three units of mysql, one to a new LXD container on machine 7,
and the others to new machines:

    juju add-unit mysql -n 3 --to lxd:7

Add a unit of mysql to LXD container number 3 on machine 24:

    juju add-unit mysql --to 24/lxd/3

Add a unit of mysql to LXD container on a new machine:

    juju add-unit mysql --to lxd


## Details
The add-unit is used to scale out an application for improved performance or
availability.

The usage of this command differs depending on whether it is being used on a
k8s or cloud model.

Many charms will seamlessly support horizontal scaling while others may need
an additional application support (e.g. a separate load balancer). See the
documentation for specific charms to check how scale-out is supported.

For k8s models the only valid argument is -n, --num-units.
Anything additional will result in an error.

Example:

Add five units of mysql:
    juju add-unit mysql --num-units 5


For cloud models, by default, units are deployed to newly provisioned machines
in accordance with any application or model constraints.

This command also supports the placement directive ("--to") for targeting
specific machines or containers, which will bypass application and model
constraints. --to accepts a comma-separated list of placement specifications
(see examples below). If the length of this list is less than the number of
units being added, the remaining units will be added in the default way (i.e.
to new machines).

    juju autoload-credentials aws


## Details

The command searches well known, cloud-specific locations on this client.
If credential information is found, it is presented to the user
in a series of prompts to facilitated interactive addition and upload.
An alternative to this command is `juju add-credential`

After validating the contents, credentials are added to
this Juju client if --client is specified.

To upload credentials to a controller, use --controller option. 

Below are the cloud types for which credentials may be autoloaded,
including the locations searched.

EC2
  Credentials and regions:
    1. On Linux, $HOME/.aws/credentials and $HOME/.aws/config
    2. Environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

GCE
  Credentials:
    1. A JSON file whose path is specified by the
       GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
    2. On Linux, $HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json
       Default region is specified by the CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION environment
       variable.

# BIND

## Summary
Change bindings for a deployed application.

## Usage
```juju bind [options] <application> [<default-space>] [<endpoint-name>=<space> ...]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--force` | false | Allow endpoints to be bound to spaces that might not be available to all existing units |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

To update the default binding for the application and automatically update all
existing endpoint bindings that were referencing the old default, you can use 
the following syntax:

  juju bind foo new-default

To bind individual endpoints to a space you can use the following syntax:

  juju bind foo endpoint-1=space-1 endpoint-2=space-2

Finally, the above commands can be combined to update both the default space
and individual endpoints in one go:

  juju bind foo new-default endpoint-1=space-1



## Details

In order to be able to bind any endpoint to a space, all machines where the
application units are deployed to are required to be configured with an address
in that space. However, you can use the --force option to bypass this check.

    # For a bootstrap on k8s, setting the service type of the Juju controller service to External
    juju bootstrap --config controller-service-type=external --config controller-external-name=controller.juju.is


## Details
Used without arguments, bootstrap will step you through the process of
initializing a Juju cloud environment. Initialization consists of creating
a 'controller' model and provisioning a machine to act as controller.

We recommend you call your controller ‘username-region’ e.g. ‘fred-us-east-1’
See --clouds for a list of clouds and credentials.
See --regions &lt;cloud&gt; for a list of available regions for a given cloud.

Credentials are set beforehand and are distinct from any other
configuration (see `juju add-credential`).
The 'controller' model typically does not run workloads. It should remain
pristine to run and manage Juju's own infrastructure for the corresponding
cloud. Additional models should be created with `juju add-model` for workload purposes.
Note that a 'default' model is also created and becomes the current model
of the environment once the command completes. It can be discarded if
other models are created.

If '--bootstrap-constraints' is used, its values will also apply to any
future controllers provisioned for high availability (HA).

If '--constraints' is used, its values will be set as the default
constraints for all future workload machines in the model, exactly as if
the constraints were set with `juju set-model-constraints`.

It is possible to override constraints and the automatic machine selection
algorithm by assigning a "placement directive" via the '--to' option. This
dictates what machine to use for the controller. This would typically be
used with the MAAS provider ('--to &lt;host&gt;.maas').

You can change the default timeout and retry delays used during the
bootstrap by changing the following settings in your configuration
(all values represent number of seconds):
    # How long to wait for a connection to the controller
    bootstrap-timeout: 1200 # default: 20 minutes
    # How long to wait between connection attempts to a controller
address.
    bootstrap-retry-delay: 5 # default: 5 seconds
    # How often to refresh controller addresses from the API server.
    bootstrap-addresses-delay: 10 # default: 10 seconds

It is possible to override the base e.g. ubuntu@22.04, Juju attempts 
to bootstrap on to, by supplying a base argument to '--bootstrap-base'.

An error is emitted if the determined base is not supported. Using the
'--force' option to override this check:

	juju bootstrap --bootstrap-base=ubuntu@22.04 --force

The '--bootstrap-series' can be still used, but is deprecated in favour
of '--bootstrap-base'.

Private clouds may need to specify their own custom image metadata and
tools/agent. Use '--metadata-source' whose value is a local directory.

By default, the Juju version of the agent binary that is downloaded and
installed on all models for the new controller will be the same as that
of the Juju client used to perform the bootstrap.
However, a user can specify a different agent version via '--agent-version'
option to bootstrap command. Juju will use this version for models' agents
as long as the client's version is from the same Juju release series.
In other words, a 2.2.1 client can bootstrap any 2.2.x agents but cannot
bootstrap any 2.0.x or 2.1.x agents.
The agent version can be specified a simple numeric version, e.g. 2.2.4.

For example, at the time when 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 are released and your
agent stream is 'released' (default), then a 2.3.1 client can bootstrap:
    * 2.3.0 controller by running '... bootstrap --agent-version=2.3.0 ...';
    * 2.3.1 controller by running '... bootstrap ...';
    * 2.3.2 controller by running 'bootstrap --auto-upgrade'.
However, if this client has a copy of codebase, then a local copy of Juju
will be built and bootstrapped - 2.3.1.1.

Bootstrapping to a k8s cluster requires that the service set up to handle
requests to the controller be accessible outside the cluster. Typically this
means a service type of LoadBalancer is needed, and Juju does create such a
service if it knows it is supported by the cluster. This is performed by
interrogating the cluster for a well known managed deployment such as microk8s,
GKE or EKS.

When bootstrapping to a k8s cluster Juju does not recognise, there's no
guarantee a load balancer is available, so Juju defaults to a controller
service type of ClusterIP. This may not be suitable, so there's 3 bootstrap
options available to tell Juju how to set up the controller service. Part of
the solution may require a load balancer for the cluster to be set up manually
first, or perhaps an external k8s service via a FQDN will be used
(this is a cluster specific implementation decision which Juju needs to be
informed about so it can set things up correctly). The 3 relevant bootstrap
options are (see list of bootstrap config items below for a full explanation):

- controller-service-type
- controller-external-name
- controller-external-ips

If a storage pool is specified using --storage-pool, this will be created
in the controller model.

name, number of regions, number of registered credentials, default region, type, etc...

Clouds known to this client are the clouds known to Juju out of the box 
along with any which have been added with `add-cloud --client`. These clouds can be
used to create a controller and can be displayed using --client option.

Clouds may be listed that are co-hosted with the Juju client.  When the LXD hypervisor
is detected, the 'localhost' cloud is made available.  When a microk8s installation is
detected, the 'microk8s' cloud is displayed.

Use --controller option to list clouds from a controller. 
Use --client option to list clouds from this client. 
This command's default output format is 'tabular'. Use 'json' and 'yaml' for
machine-readable output.

Cloud metadata sometimes changes, e.g. providers add regions. Use the `update-public-clouds`
command to update public clouds or `update-cloud` to update other clouds.

Use the `regions` command to list a cloud's regions.

Use the `show-cloud` command to get more detail, such as regions and endpoints.

| `--no-color` | false | Disable ANSI color codes in tabular output |
| `--o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |
| `--reset` |  | Reset the provided comma delimited keys |

## Details

To view all configuration values for an application, run
    juju config <app>
By default, the config will be printed in yaml format. You can instead print it
in json format using the --format flag:
    juju config <app> --format json

To view the value of a single config key, run
    juju config <app> key
To set config values, run
    juju config <app> key1=val1 key2=val2 ...
This sets "key1" to "val1", etc. Using the @ directive, you can set a config
key's value to the contents of a file:
    juju config <app> key=@/tmp/configvalue
You can also reset config keys to their default values:
    juju config <app> --reset key1
    juju config <app> --reset key1,key2,key3
You may simultaneously set some keys and reset others:
    juju config <app> key1=val1 key2=val2 --reset key3,key4

Config values can be imported from a yaml file using the --file flag:
    juju config <app> --file=path/to/cfg.yaml
The yaml file should be in the following format:
    apache2:                        # application name
      servername: "example.com"     # key1: val1
      lb_balancer_timeout: 60       # key2: val2
      ...
This allows you to e.g. save an app's config to a file:
    juju config app1 > cfg.yaml
and then import the config later. You can also read from stdin using "-",
which allows you to pipe config values from one app to another:
    juju config app1 | juju config app2 --file -
You can simultaneously read config from a yaml file and set/reset config keys
as above. The command-line args will override any values specified in the file.

By default, any configuration changes will be applied to the currently active
branch. A specific branch can be targeted using the --branch option. Changes
can be immediately be applied to the model by specifying --branch=master. For
example:

juju config apache2 --branch=master servername=example.com
juju config apache2 --branch test-branch servername=staging.example.com

Rather than specifying each setting name/value inline, the --file flag option
may be used to provide a list of settings to be updated as a yaml file. The
yaml file contents must include a single top-level key with the application's
name followed by a dictionary of key/value pairs that correspond to the names
and values of the settings to be set. For instance, to configure apache2,
the following yaml file can be used:

apache2:
  servername: "example.com"
  lb_balancer_timeout: 60

If the above yaml document is stored in a file called config.yaml, the
following command can be used to apply the config changes:

juju config apache2 --file config.yaml

Finally, the --reset flag can be used to revert one or more configuration
settings back to their default value as defined in the charm metadata:

juju config apache2 --reset servername
juju config apache2 --reset servername,lb_balancer_timeout

| `--o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |

## Examples

    juju constraints mysql
    juju constraints -m mymodel apache2


## Details

Shows machine constraints that have been set for an application with `juju set-
constraints`.
By default, the model is the current model.
Application constraints are combined with model constraints, set with `juju 
set-model-constraints`, for commands (such as 'deploy') that provision
machines for applications. Where model and application constraints overlap, the
application constraints take precedence.
Constraints for a specific model can be viewed with `juju model-
constraints`.

# CONSUME
> See also: [integrate](#integrate), [offer](#offer), [remove-saas](#remove-saas)

## Summary
Add a remote offer to the model.

## Usage
```juju consume [options] <remote offer path> [<local application name>]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

    juju consume othermodel.mysql
    juju consume owner/othermodel.mysql
    juju consume anothercontroller:owner/othermodel.mysql


## Details
Adds a remote offer to the model. Relations can be created later using "juju relate".

The path to the remote offer is formatted as follows:

    [<controller name>:][<model owner>/]<model name>.<application name>
        
If the controller name is omitted, Juju will use the currently active
controller. Similarly, if the model owner is omitted, Juju will use the user
that is currently logged in to the controller providing the offer.

# CONTROLLER-CONFIG
> See also: [controllers](#controllers), [model-config](#model-config), [show-cloud](#show-cloud)

## Summary
Displays or sets configuration settings for a controller.

## Usage
```juju controller-config [options] [<attribute key>[=<value>] ...]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--color` | false | Use ANSI color codes in output |
| `--file` |  | path to yaml-formatted configuration file |
| `--format` | tabular | Specify output format (json&#x7c;tabular&#x7c;yaml) |
| `--ignore-read-only-fields` | false | Ignore read only fields that might cause errors to be emitted while processing yaml documents |
| `--no-color` | false | Disable ANSI color codes in tabular output |
| `--o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |

## Examples

Print all config values for the current controller:

    juju controller-config

Print the value of "api-port" for the current controller:

    juju controller-config api-port

Print all config values for the controller "mycontroller":

    juju controller-config -c mycontroller

Set the "auditing-enabled" and "audit-log-max-backups" keys:

    juju controller-config auditing-enabled=true audit-log-max-backups=5

Set the current controller's config from a yaml file:

    juju controller-config --file path/to/file.yaml


## Details

To view all configuration values for the current controller, run
    juju controller-config
You can target a specific controller using the -c flag:
    juju controller-config -c <controller>
By default, the config will be printed in a tabular format. You can instead
print it in json or yaml format using the --format flag:
    juju controller-config --format json
    juju controller-config --format yaml

To view the value of a single config key, run
    juju controller-config key
To set config values, run
    juju controller-config key1=val1 key2=val2 ...

Config values can be imported from a yaml file using the --file flag:
    juju controller-config --file=path/to/cfg.yaml
This allows you to e.g. save a controller's config to a file:
    juju controller-config --format=yaml > cfg.yaml
and then import the config later. Note that the output of controller-config
may include read-only values, which will cause an error when importing later.
To prevent the error, use the --ignore-read-only-fields flag:
    juju controller-config --file=cfg.yaml --ignore-read-only-fields

You can also read from stdin using "-", which allows you to pipe config values
from one controller to another:
    juju controller-config -c c1 --format=yaml \
      | juju controller-config -c c2 --file=- --ignore-read-only-fields
You can simultaneously read config from a yaml file and set config keys
as above. The command-line args will override any values specified in the file.

# CREATE-BACKUP
> See also: [download-backup](#download-backup)

## Summary
Create a backup.

## Usage
```juju create-backup [options] [<notes>]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--filename` | juju-backup-&lt;date&gt;-&lt;time&gt;.tar.gz | Download to this file |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |
| `--no-download` | false | Do not download the archive. DEPRECATED. |

## Examples

    juju create-backup 
    juju create-backup --no-download


## Details

This command requests that Juju creates a backup of its state.
You may provide a note to associate with the backup.

By default, the backup archive and associated metadata are downloaded.

Use --no-download to avoid getting a local copy of the backup downloaded 
at the end of the backup process. In this case it is recommended that the
model config attribute "backup-dir" be set to point to a path where the
backup archives should be stored long term. This could be a remotely mounted
filesystem; the same path must exist on each controller if using HA.

Use --verbose to see extra information about backup.

To access remote backups stored on the controller, see 'juju download-backup'.

# CREATE-STORAGE-POOL
> See also: [remove-storage-pool](#remove-storage-pool), [update-storage-pool](#update-storage-pool), [storage-pools](#storage-pools)

## Summary
Create or define a storage pool.

## Usage
```juju create-storage-pool [options] <name> <provider> [<key>=<value> [<key>=<value>...]]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

    juju create-storage-pool ebsrotary ebs volume-type=standard
    juju create-storage-pool gcepd storage-provisioner=kubernetes.io/gce-pd [storage-mode=RWX|RWO|ROX] parameters.type=pd-standard



## Details

Pools are a mechanism for administrators to define sources of storage that
they will use to satisfy application storage requirements.

A single pool might be used for storage from units of many different applications -
it is a resource from which different stores may be drawn.

A pool describes provider-specific parameters for creating storage,
such as performance (e.g. IOPS), media type (e.g. magnetic vs. SSD),
or durability.

For many providers, there will be a shared resource
where storage can be requested (e.g. EBS in amazon).
Creating pools there maps provider specific settings
into named resources that can be used during deployment.

Pools defined at the model level are easily reused across applications.
Pool creation requires a pool name, the provider type and attributes for
configuration as space-separated pairs, e.g. tags, size, path, etc.

For Kubernetes models, the provider type defaults to "kubernetes"
unless otherwise specified.

# CREDENTIALS
> See also: [add-credential](#add-credential), [update-credential](#update-credential), [remove-credential](#remove-credential), [default-credential](#default-credential), [autoload-credentials](#autoload-credentials), [show-credential](#show-credential)

## Summary
Lists Juju credentials for a cloud.

## Usage
```juju credentials [options] [<cloud name>]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--client` | false | Client operation |
| `--format` | tabular | Specify output format (json&#x7c;tabular&#x7c;yaml) |
| `--o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |
| `--show-secrets` | false | Show secrets, applicable to yaml or json formats only |

## Examples

    juju credentials
    juju credentials aws
    juju credentials aws --client
    juju credentials --format yaml --show-secrets
    juju credentials --controller mycontroller
    juju credentials --controller mycontroller --client


## Details
This command list credentials from this client and credentials
from a controller.

Locally stored credentials are client specific and 
are used with `juju bootstrap`  
and `juju add-model`. It's paramount to understand that
different client devices may have different locally stored credentials
for the same user.

Remotely stored credentials or controller stored credentials are
stored on the controller.

An arbitrary "credential name" is used to represent credentials, which are 
added either via `juju add-credential` or `juju autoload-credentials`.
Note that there can be multiple sets of credentials and, thus, multiple 
names.

Actual authentication material is exposed with the '--show-secrets' 
option in json or yaml formats. Secrets are not shown in tabular format.

A controller, and subsequently created models, can be created with a 
different set of credentials but any action taken within the model (e.g.:
`juju deploy`; `juju add-unit`) applies the credential used 
to create that model. This model credential is stored on the controller. 

A credential for 'controller' model is determined at bootstrap time and
will be stored on the controller. It is considered to be controller default.

Recall that when a controller is created a 'default' model is also 
created. This model will use the controller default credential. 
To see details of your credentials use "juju show-credential" command.

When adding a new model, Juju will reuse the controller default credential.
To add a model that uses a different credential, specify a  credential
from this client using --credential option. See `juju help add-model` 
for more information.

Credentials denoted with an asterisk '*' are currently set as the user default
for a given cloud.

Use --controller option to list credentials from a controller.

Use --client option to list credentials known locally on this client.

# DASHBOARD

## Summary
Print the Juju Dashboard URL, or open the Juju Dashboard in the default browser.

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--browser` | false | Open the web browser, instead of just printing the Juju Dashboard URL |
| `--hide-credential` | false | Do not show admin credential to use for logging into the Juju Dashboard |

| `--port` | 31666 | Local port used to serve the dashboard |

## Examples

Print the Juju Dashboard URL and show admin credential to use to log into it:

	juju dashboard

Print the Juju Dashboard URL only:

	juju dashboard --hide-credential

Open the Juju Dashboard in the default browser and show admin credential to use to log into it:

	juju dashboard --browser

Open the Juju Dashboard in the default browser without printing the login credential:

	juju dashboard --hide-credential --browser

An error is returned if the Juju Dashboard is not running.

Similar to 'juju debug-hooks' but rather than dropping you into a shell prompt, 
it runs the hooks and sets the JUJU_DEBUG_AT environment variable. 
Charms that implement support for this should use it to set breakpoints based on the environment
variable.

See the "juju help ssh" for information about SSH related options
accepted by the debug-hooks command.

    juju debug-log --replay --level WARNING


## Details

This command provides access to all logged Juju activity on a per-model
basis. By default, the logs for the currently select model are shown.

Each log line is emitted in this format:

  &lt;entity&gt; &lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;log-level&gt; &lt;module&gt;:&lt;line-no&gt; &lt;message&gt;

The "entity" is the source of the message: a machine or unit. The names for
machines and units can be seen in the output of `juju status`.

The '--include' and '--exclude' options filter by entity. The entity can be
a machine, unit, or application for vm models, but can be application only
for k8s models. These filters support wildcards `*` if filtering on the
entity full name (prefixed by `<entity type>-`)

The '--include-module' and '--exclude-module' options filter by (dotted)
logging module name. The module name can be truncated such that all loggers
with the prefix will match.

The '--include-label' and '--exclude-label' options filter by logging label. 

The filtering options combine as follows:
* All --include options are logically ORed together.
* All --exclude options are logically ORed together.
* All --include-module options are logically ORed together.
* All --exclude-module options are logically ORed together.
* All --include-label options are logically ORed together.
* All --exclude-label options are logically ORed together.
* The combined --include, --exclude, --include-module, --exclude-module,
  --include-label and --exclude-label selections are logically ANDed to form
  the complete filter.

## Summary
Sets local default credentials for a cloud on this client.

## Usage
```juju default-credential [options] <cloud name> [<credential name>]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--reset` | false | Reset default credential for the cloud |

## Examples

    juju default-credential google credential_name

## Details
The default credentials are specified with a "credential name". 

A credential name is created during the process of adding credentials either 
via `juju add-credential` or `juju autoload-credentials`. 
Credential names can be listed with `juju credentials`.

This command sets a locally stored credential to be used as a default.
Default credentials avoid the need to specify a particular set of 
credentials when more than one are available for a given cloud.

To unset previously set default credential for a cloud, use --reset option.

To view currently set default credential for a cloud, use the command
without a credential name argument.

Deploy a k8s charm that requires a single Nvidia GPU:

    juju deploy mycharm --device miner=1,nvidia.com/gpu

Deploy a k8s charm that requires two Nvidia GPUs that have an
attribute of 'gpu=nvidia-tesla-p100':

    juju deploy mycharm --device \
       twingpu=2,nvidia.com/gpu,gpu=nvidia-tesla-p100


## Details

A charm or bundle can be referred to by its simple name and a base, revision,
or channel can optionally be specified:

  juju deploy postgresql
  juju deploy ch:postgresql --base ubuntu@22.04
  juju deploy ch:postgresql --channel edge
  juju deploy ch:ubuntu --revision 17 --channel edge

All the above deployments use remote charms found in Charmhub, denoted by the
'ch:' prefix.  Remote charms with no prefix will be deployed from Charmhub.

If a channel is specified, it will be used as the source for looking up the
charm or bundle from Charmhub. When used in a bundle deployment context,
the specified channel is only used for retrieving the bundle and is ignored when
looking up the charms referenced by the bundle. However, each charm within a
bundle is allowed to explicitly specify the channel used to look it up.

If a revision is specified, a channel must also be specified for Charmhub charms
and bundles.  The charm will be deployed with revision.  The channel will be used
when refreshing the application in the future.

A local charm may be deployed by giving the path to its directory:

  juju deploy /path/to/charm
  juju deploy /path/to/charm ---base ubuntu@22.04

You will need to be explicit if there is an ambiguity between a local and a
remote charm:

  juju deploy ./pig
  juju deploy ch:pig

A bundle can be expressed similarly to a charm:

  juju deploy mediawiki-single
  juju deploy mediawiki-single --base ubuntu@22.04
  juju deploy ch:mediawiki-single

A local bundle may be deployed by specifying the path to its YAML file:

  juju deploy /path/to/bundle.yaml

The final charm/machine base is determined using an order of precedence (most
preferred to least):

 - the '--base' command option
 - for a bundle, the series stated in each charm URL (in the bundle file)
 - for a bundle, the series given at the top level (in the bundle file)
 - the 'default-base' model key
 - the first base specified in the charm's manifest file

An 'application name' provides an alternate name for the application. It works
only for charms; it is silently ignored for bundles (although the same can be
done at the bundle file level). Such a name must consist only of lower-case
letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and single hyphens (-). The name must begin with
a letter and not have a group of all numbers follow a hyphen:

  Valid:   myappname, custom-app, app2-scat-23skidoo
  Invalid: myAppName, custom--app, app2-scat-23, areacode-555-info

Use the '--constraints' option to specify hardware requirements for new machines.
These become the application's default constraints (i.e. they are used if the
application is later scaled out with the `add-unit` command). To overcome this
behaviour use the `set-constraints` command to change the application's default
constraints or add a machine (`add-machine`) with a certain constraint and then
target that machine with `add-unit` by using the '--to' option.

Use the '--device' option to specify GPU device requirements (with Kubernetes).
The below format is used for this option's value, where the 'label' is named in
the charm metadata file:

  &lt;label&gt;=[&lt;count&gt;,]&lt;device-class&gt;&#x7c;&lt;vendor/type&gt;[,&lt;attributes&gt;]

Use the '--config' option to specify application configuration values. This
option accepts either a path to a YAML-formatted file or a key=value pair. A
file should be of this format:

  &lt;charm name&gt;:
	&lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;
	...

For example, to deploy 'mediawiki' with file 'mycfg.yaml' that contains:

  mediawiki:
	name: my media wiki
	admins: me:pwdOne
	debug: true

use

  juju deploy mediawiki --config mycfg.yaml

Key=value pairs can also be passed directly in the command. For example, to
declare the 'name' key:

  juju deploy mediawiki --config name='my media wiki'

To define multiple keys:

  juju deploy mediawiki --config name='my media wiki' --config debug=true

If a key gets defined multiple times the last value will override any earlier
values. For example,

  juju deploy mediawiki --config name='my media wiki' --config mycfg.yaml

Similar to the 'juju config' command, if the value begins with an '@' character,
it will be treated as a path to a config file and its contents will be assigned
to the specified key. For example,

  juju deploy mediawiki --config name='@wiki-name.txt"

will set the 'name' key to the contents of file 'wiki-name.txt'.

If mycfg.yaml contains a value for 'name', it will override the earlier 'my
media wiki' value. The same applies to single value options. For example,

  juju deploy mediawiki --config name='a media wiki' --config name='my wiki'

the value of 'my wiki' will be used.

Use the '--resource' option to upload resources needed by the charm. This
option may be repeated if multiple resources are needed:

  juju deploy foo --resource bar=/some/file.tgz --resource baz=./docs/cfg.xml

Where 'bar' and 'baz' are named in the metadata file for charm 'foo'.

Use the '--to' option to deploy to an existing machine or container by
specifying a "placement directive". The `status` command should be used for
guidance on how to refer to machines. A few placement directives are
provider-dependent (e.g.: 'zone').

In more complex scenarios, "network spaces" are used to partition the cloud
networking layer into sets of subnets. Instances hosting units inside the same
space can communicate with each other without any firewalls. Traffic crossing
space boundaries could be subject to firewall and access restrictions. Using
spaces as deployment targets, rather than their individual subnets, allows Juju
to perform automatic distribution of units across availability zones to support
high availability for applications. Spaces help isolate applications and their
units, both for security purposes and to manage both traffic segregation and
congestion.

When deploying an application or adding machines, the 'spaces' constraint can
be used to define a comma-delimited list of required and forbidden spaces (the
latter prefixed with '^', similar to the 'tags' constraint).

When deploying bundles, machines specified in the bundle are added to the model
as new machines. Use the '--map-machines=existing' option to make use of any
existing machines. To map particular existing machines to machines defined in
the bundle, multiple comma separated values of the form 'bundle-id=existing-id'
can be passed. For example, for a bundle that specifies machines 1, 2, and 3;
and a model that has existing machines 1, 2, 3, and 4, the below deployment
would have existing machines 1 and 2 assigned to machines 1 and 2 defined in
the bundle and have existing machine 4 assigned to machine 3 defined in the
bundle.

  juju deploy mybundle --map-machines=existing,3=4

Only top level machines can be mapped in this way, just as only top level
machines can be defined in the machines section of the bundle.

When charms that include LXD profiles are deployed the profiles are validated
for security purposes by allowing only certain configurations and devices. Use
the '--force' option to bypass this check. Doing so is not recommended as it
can lead to unexpected behaviour.

# DESTROY-CONTROLLER
> See also: [kill-controller](#kill-controller), [unregister](#unregister)

## Summary
Destroys a controller.

## Usage
```juju destroy-controller [options] <controller name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--destroy-all-models` | false | Destroy all models in the controller |
| `--destroy-storage` | false | Destroy all storage instances managed by the controller |
| `--force` | false | Force destroy models ignoring any errors |
| `--model-timeout` | -1s | Timeout for each step of force model destruction |
| `--no-prompt` | false | Do not ask for confirmation |
| `--no-wait` | false | Rush through model destruction without waiting for each individual step to complete |
| `--release-storage` | false | Release all storage instances from management of the controller, without destroying them |

## Examples

Destroy the controller and all models. If there is
persistent storage remaining in any of the models, then
this will prompt you to choose to either destroy or release
the storage.

    juju destroy-controller --destroy-all-models mycontroller

Destroy the controller and all models, destroying
any remaining persistent storage.

    juju destroy-controller --destroy-all-models --destroy-storage

Destroy the controller and all models, releasing
any remaining persistent storage from Juju's control.

    juju destroy-controller --destroy-all-models --release-storage

Destroy the controller and all models, continuing
even if there are operational errors.

    juju destroy-controller --destroy-all-models --force
    juju destroy-controller --destroy-all-models --force --no-wait


## Details
All workload models running on the controller will first
need to be destroyed, either in advance, or by
specifying `--destroy-all-models`.

If there is persistent storage in any of the models managed by the
controller, then you must choose to either destroy or release the
storage, using `--destroy-storage` or `--release-storage` respectively.

Sometimes, the destruction of a model may fail as Juju encounters errors
that need to be dealt with before that model can be destroyed.
However, at times, there is a need to destroy a controller ignoring
such model errors. In these rare cases, use --force option but note 
that --force will also remove all units of any hosted applications, their subordinates
and, potentially, machines without given them the opportunity to shutdown cleanly.

Model destruction is a multi-step process. Under normal circumstances, Juju will not
proceed to the next step until the current step has finished. 
However, when using --force, users can also specify --no-wait to progress through steps 
without delay waiting for each step to complete.

WARNING: Passing --force with --model-timeout will continue the final destruction without
consideration or respect for clean shutdown or resource cleanup. If model-timeout 
elapses with --force, you may have resources left behind that will require
manual cleanup. If --force --model-timeout 0 is passed, the models are brutally
removed with haste. It is recommended to use graceful destroy (without --force, --no-wait or
--model-timeout).

# DESTROY-MODEL
> See also: [destroy-controller](#destroy-controller)

## Summary
Terminate all machines/containers and resources for a non-controller model.

## Usage
```juju destroy-model [options] [<controller name>:]<model name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--destroy-storage` | false | Destroy all storage instances in the model |
| `--force` | false | Force destroy model ignoring any errors |
| `--no-prompt` | false | Do not ask for confirmation |
| `--no-wait` | false | Rush through model destruction without waiting for each individual step to complete |
| `--release-storage` | false | Release all storage instances from the model, and management of the controller, without destroying them |
| `--t`, `--timeout` | -1s | Timeout for each step of force model destruction |

## Examples

    juju destroy-model --no-prompt mymodel
    juju destroy-model --no-prompt mymodel --destroy-storage
    juju destroy-model --no-prompt mymodel --release-storage
    juju destroy-model --no-prompt mymodel --force
    juju destroy-model --no-prompt mymodel --force --no-wait


## Details

Destroys the specified model. This will result in the non-recoverable
removal of all the units operating in the model and any resources stored
there. Due to the irreversible nature of the command, it will prompt for
confirmation (unless overridden with the '-y' option) before taking any
action.

If there is persistent storage in any of the models managed by the
controller, then you must choose to either destroy or release the
storage, using --destroy-storage or --release-storage respectively.

Sometimes, the destruction of the model may fail as Juju encounters errors
and failures that need to be dealt with before a model can be destroyed.
However, at times, there is a need to destroy a model ignoring
all operational errors. In these rare cases, use --force option but note 
that --force will also remove all units of the application, its subordinates
and, potentially, machines without given them the opportunity to shutdown cleanly.

Model destruction is a multi-step process. Under normal circumstances, Juju will not
proceed to the next step until the current step has finished. 
However, when using --force, users can also specify --no-wait to progress through steps 
without delay waiting for each step to complete.

WARNING: Passing --force with --timeout will continue the final destruction without
consideration or respect for clean shutdown or resource cleanup. If timeout 
elapses with --force, you may have resources left behind that will require
manual cleanup. If --force --timeout 0 is passed, the model is brutally
removed with haste. It is recommended to use graceful destroy (without --force or --no-wait).

# DETACH-STORAGE

## Summary
Detaches storage from units.

## Usage
```juju detach-storage [options] <storage> [<storage> ...]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--force` | false | Forcefully detach storage |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

    juju detach-storage pgdata/0
    juju detach-storage --force pgdata/0



## Details

Detaches storage from units. Specify one or more unit/application storage IDs,
as output by "juju storage". The storage will remain in the model until it is
removed by an operator.

Detaching storage may fail but under some circumstances, Juju user may need 
to force storage detachment despite operational errors.

# DIFF-BUNDLE
> See also: [deploy](#deploy)

## Summary
Compare a bundle with a model and report any differences.

## Usage
```juju diff-bundle [options] <bundle file or name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--annotations` | false | Include differences in annotations |
| `--arch` |  | specify an arch &lt;all&#x7c;amd64&#x7c;arm64&#x7c;ppc64el&#x7c;riscv64&#x7c;s390x&gt; |
| `--base` |  | specify a base |
| `--channel` |  | Channel to use when getting the bundle from Charmhub |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |
| `--map-machines` |  | Indicates how existing machines correspond to bundle machines |
| `--overlay` |  | Bundles to overlay on the primary bundle, applied in order |
| `--series` |  | specify a series. DEPRECATED: use --base |

## Examples

    juju diff-bundle localbundle.yaml
    juju diff-bundle charmed-kubernetes
    juju diff-bundle charmed-kubernetes --overlay local-config.yaml --overlay extra.yaml
	juju diff-bundle charmed-kubernetes --base ubuntu@22.04
    juju diff-bundle -m othermodel hadoop-spark
    juju diff-bundle localbundle.yaml --map-machines 3=4


## Details

Bundle can be a local bundle file or the name of a bundle in
Charmhub. The bundle can also be combined with overlays (in the
same way as the deploy command) before comparing with the model.

The map-machines option works similarly as for the deploy command, but
existing is always assumed, so it doesn't need to be specified.

Config values for comparison are always source from the "current" model
generation.

Specifying a base will retrieve the bundle for the relevant store for
the give base.

# DISABLE-COMMAND
> See also: [disabled-commands](#disabled-commands), [enable-command](#enable-command)

## Summary
Disable commands for the model.

## Usage
```juju disable-command [options] <command set> [message...]```

# ENABLE-DESTROY-CONTROLLER
> See also: [disable-command](#disable-command), [disabled-commands](#disabled-commands), [enable-command](#enable-command)

## Summary
Enable destroy-controller by removing disabled commands in the controller.

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |

## Details

Any model in the controller that has disabled commands will block a controller
from being destroyed.

A controller administrator is able to enable all the commands across all the models
in a Juju controller so that the controller can be destoyed if desired.


---

# ENABLE-HA

## Summary
Ensure that sufficient controllers exist to provide redundancy.

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--constraints` |  | Additional machine constraints |
| `--format` | simple | Specify output format (json&#x7c;simple&#x7c;yaml) |
| `--n` | 0 | Number of controllers to make available |
| `--o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |
| `--to` |  | The machine(s) to become controllers, bypasses constraints |

## Examples

Ensure that the controller is still in highly available mode. If there is only 1 controller running, this will ensure there
are 3 running. If you have previously requested more than 3,
then that number will be ensured.

    juju enable-ha

Ensure that 5 controllers are available:

    juju enable-ha -n 5 

Ensure that 7 controllers are available, with newly created
controller machines having at least 8GB RAM.

    juju enable-ha -n 7 --constraints mem=8G

Ensure that 7 controllers are available, with machines server1 and
server2 used first, and if necessary, newly created controller
machines having at least 8GB RAM.

    juju enable-ha -n 7 --to server1,server2 --constraints mem=8G


## Details

To ensure availability of deployed applications, the Juju infrastructure
must itself be highly available. The enable-ha command will ensure
that the specified number of controller machines are used to make up the
controller.

An odd number of controllers is required.

---

# EXEC

## Summary
Run the commands on the remote targets specified.

## Usage
```juju exec [options] <commands>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--a`, `--app`, `--application` |  | One or more application names |
| `--all` | false | Run the commands on all the machines |
| `--background` | false | Run the task in the background |
| `--color` | false | Use ANSI color codes in output |
| `--execution-group` |  | Commands in the same execution group are run sequentially |
| `--format` | plain | Specify output format (json&#x7c;plain&#x7c;yaml) |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |
| `--machine` |  | One or more machine ids |
| `--no-color` | false | Disable ANSI color codes in output |
| `--o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |
| `--operator` | false | Run the commands on the operator (k8s-only) |
| `--parallel` | true | Run the commands in parallel without first acquiring a lock |
| `--u`, `--unit` |  | One or more unit ids |
| `--utc` | false | Show times in UTC |
| `--wait` | 0s | Maximum wait time for a task to complete |

## Details

Run a shell command on the specified targets. Only admin users of a model
are able to use this command.

Targets are specified using either machine ids, application names or unit
names.  At least one target specifier is needed.

Multiple values can be set for --machine, --application, and --unit by using
comma separated values.

Depending on the type of target, the user which the command runs as will be:
  unit -&gt; "root"
  machine -&gt; "ubuntu"
The target and user are independent of whether --all or --application are used.
For example, --all will run as "ubuntu" on machines and "root" on units.
And --application will run as "root" on all units of that application.

Some options are shortened for usabilty purpose in CLI
--application can also be specified as --app and -a
--unit can also be specified as -u

Valid unit identifiers are: 
  a standard unit ID, such as mysql/0 or;
  leader syntax of the form &lt;application&gt;/leader, such as mysql/leader.

If the target is an application, the command is run on all units for that
application. For example, if there was an application "mysql" and that application
had two units, "mysql/0" and "mysql/1", then
  --application mysql
is equivalent to
  --unit mysql/0,mysql/1

If --operator is provided on k8s models, commands are executed on the operator
instead of the workload. On IAAS models, --operator has no effect.

Commands run for applications or units are executed in a 'hook context' for
the unit.

Commands run on machines via the --machine argument are run in parallel
by default.
If you want commands to be run sequentially in order of submission,
use --parallel=false.
Such commands will first acquire a global execution lock on the host machine
before running, and release the lock when done.
It's also possible to group commands so that those in the same group run
sequentially, but in parallel with other groups. This is done using
--execution-group=somegroup.

--all is provided as a simple way to run the command on all the machines
in the model.  If you specify --all you cannot provide additional
targets.

Since juju exec creates tasks, you can query for the status of commands
started with juju run by calling 
"juju operations --machines &lt;id&gt;,... --actions juju-exec".

If you need to pass options to the command being run, you must precede the
command and its arguments with "--", to tell "juju exec" to stop processing
those arguments. For example:

    juju exec --all -- hostname -f

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--filename` |  | Bundle file |
| `--include-charm-defaults` | false | Whether to include charm config default values in the exported bundle |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

    juju export-bundle
    juju export-bundle --filename mymodel.yaml
    juju export-bundle --include-charm-defaults


## Details

# EXPOSE
> See also: [unexpose](#unexpose)

## Summary
Makes an application publicly available over the network.

## Usage
```juju expose [options] <application name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--endpoints` |  | Expose only the ports that charms have opened for this comma-delimited list of endpoints |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |
| `--to-cidrs` |  | A comma-delimited list of CIDRs that should be able to access the application ports once exposed |
| `--to-spaces` |  | A comma-delimited list of spaces that should be able to access the application ports once exposed |

## Details
Adjusts the firewall rules and any relevant security mechanisms of the
cloud to allow public access to the application.

If no additional options are specified, the command will, by default, allow
access from 0.0.0.0/0 to all ports opened by the application. For example, to
expose all ports opened by apache2, you can run:

juju expose apache2

The --endpoints option may be used to restrict the effect of this command to 
the list of ports opened for a comma-delimited list of endpoints. For instance,
to only expose the ports opened by apache2 for the "www" endpoint, you can run:

juju expose apache2 --endpoints www

To make the selected set of ports accessible by specific CIDRs, the --to-cidrs
option may be used with a comma-delimited list of CIDR values. For example:

juju expose apache2 --to-cidrs 10.0.0.0/24,192.168.1.0/24

To make the selected set of ports accessible by specific spaces, the --to-spaces
option may be used with a comma-delimited list of space names. For example:

juju expose apache2 --to-spaces public

All of the above options can be combined together. In addition, multiple "juju
expose" invocations can be used to specify granular expose rules for different
endpoints. For example, to allow access to all opened apache ports from
0.0.0.0/0 but restrict access to any port opened for the "logs" endpoint to
CIDR 10.0.0.0/24 you can run:

juju expose apache2
juju expose apache2 --endpoints logs --to-cidrs 10.0.0.0/24

Each "juju expose" invocation always overwrites any previous expose rule for
the same endpoint name. For example, running the following commands instruct
juju to only allow access to ports opened for the "logs" endpoint from CIDR
192.168.0.0/24.

juju expose apache2 --endpoints logs --to-cidrs 10.0.0.0/24
juju expose apache2 --endpoints logs --to-cidrs 192.168.0.0/24

# IMPORT-FILESYSTEM

## Summary
Imports a filesystem into the model.

## Usage
```juju import-filesystem [options] 
<storage-provider> <provider-id> <storage-name>
```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

Import an existing filesystem backed by an EBS volume,
and assign it the "pgdata" storage name. Juju will
associate a storage instance ID like "pgdata/0" with
the volume and filesystem contained within.

    juju import-filesystem ebs vol-123456 pgdata



## Details

Import an existing filesystem into the model. This will lead to the model
taking ownership of the storage, so you must take care not to import storage
that is in use by another Juju model.

To import a filesystem, you must specify three things:

 - the storage provider which manages the storage, and with
   which the storage will be associated
 - the storage provider ID for the filesystem, or
   volume that backs the filesystem
 - the storage name to assign to the filesystem,
   corresponding to the storage name used by a charm

Once a filesystem is imported, Juju will create an associated storage
instance using the given storage name.

# IMPORT-SSH-KEY
> See also: [add-ssh-key](#add-ssh-key), [ssh-keys](#ssh-keys)

## Summary
Adds a public SSH key from a trusted identity source to a model.

## Usage
```juju import-ssh-key [options] <lp|gh>:<user identity> ...```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

Import all public keys associated with user account 'phamilton' on the
GitHub service:

    juju import-ssh-key gh:phamilton

Multiple identities may be specified in a space delimited list:

    juju import-ssh-key gh:rheinlein lp:iasmiov gh:hharrison


## Details
Juju can add SSH keys to its cache from reliable public sources (currently
Launchpad and GitHub), allowing those users SSH access to Juju machines.

The user identity supplied is the username on the respective service given by
'lp:' or 'gh:'.

If the user has multiple keys on the service, all the keys will be added.

Once the keys are imported, they can be viewed with the `juju ssh-keys`
command, where comments will indicate which ones were imported in
this way.

An alternative to this command is the more manual `juju add-ssh-key`.

## Details

Integrate two applications. Integrated applications communicate over a common
interface provided by the Juju controller that enables units to share information.
This topology allows units to share data, without needing direct connectivity
between units is restricted by firewall rules. Charms define the logic for
transferring and interpreting integration data.

The most common use of 'juju integrate' specifies two applications that co-exist
within the same model:

    juju integrate <application> <application>

Occasionally, more explicit syntax is required. Juju is able to integrate
units that span models, controllers and clouds, as described below.


Integrating applications in the same model

The most common case specifies two applications, adding specific endpoint
name(s) when required.

    juju integrate <application>[:<endpoint>] <application>[:<endpoint>]

The role and endpoint names are described by charms' metadata.yaml file.

The order does not matter, however each side must implement complementary roles.
One side implements the "provides" role and the other implements the "requires"
role. Juju can always infer the role that each side is implementing, so specifying
them is not necessary as command-line arguments.

&lt;application&gt; is the name of an application that has already been added to the
model. The Applications section of 'juju status' provides a list of current
applications.

&lt;endpoint&gt; is the name of an endpoint defined within the metadata.yaml
of the charm for &lt;application&gt;. Valid endpoint names are defined within the
"provides:" and "requires:" section of that file. Juju will request that you
specify the &lt;endpoint&gt; if there is more than one possible integration between
the two applications.


Subordinate applications

Subordinate applications are designed to be deployed alongside a primary
application. They must define a container scoped endpoint. When that endpoint
is related to a primary application, wherever a unit of the primary application
is deployed, a corresponding unit of the subordinate application will also be
deployed. Integration with the primary application has the same syntax as
integration any two applications within the same model.


Peer integrations

Integrations within an application between units (known as "peer integrations") do
not need to be added manually. They are created when the 'juju add-unit' and
'juju scale-application' commands are executed.


Cross-model integrations

Applications can be integrated, even when they are deployed to different models.
Those models may be managed by different controllers and/or be hosted on
different clouds. This functionality is known as "cross-model integration" or CMI.


Cross-model integrations: different model on the same controller

Integrating applications in models managed by the same controller
is very similar to adding an integration between applications in the same model:

    juju integrate <application>[:<endpoint>] <model>.<application>[:<endpoint>]

&lt;model&gt; is the name of the model outside of the current context. This enables the
Juju controller to bridge two models. You can list the currently available
models with 'juju models'.

To integrate models outside of the current context, add the '-m &lt;model&gt;' option:

    juju integrate -m <model> <application>[:<endpoint>] \
                     <model>.<application>[:<endpoint>]


Cross-model integrations: different controllers

Applications can be integrated with a remote application via an "offer URL" that has
been generated by the 'juju offer' command. The syntax for adding a cross-model
integration is similar to adding a local integration:

    juju integrate <application>[:<endpoint>] <offer-endpoint>

&lt;offer-endpoint&gt; describes the remote application, from the point of view of the
local one. An &lt;offer-endpoint&gt; takes one of two forms:

    <offer-alias>
    <offer-url>[:<endpoint>]

&lt;offer-alias&gt; is an alias that has been defined by the 'juju consume' command.
Use the 'juju find-offers' command to list aliases.

&lt;offer-url&gt; is a path to enable Juju to resolve communication between
controllers and the models they control.

    [[<controller>:]<user>/]<model-name>.<application-name>

&lt;controller&gt; is the name of a controller. The 'juju controllers' command
provides a list of controllers.

&lt;user&gt; is the user account of the model's owner.


Cross-model integration: network management

When the consuming side (the local application) is behind a firewall and/or
NAT is used for outbound traffic, it is possible to use the '--via' option to
inform the offering side (the remote application) the source of traffic to
enable network ports to be opened.

    ... --via <cidr-subnet>[,<cidr-subnet>[, ...]]

# KILL-CONTROLLER
> See also: [destroy-controller](#destroy-controller), [unregister](#unregister)

## Summary
Forcibly terminate all machines and other associated resources for a Juju controller.

## Usage
```juju kill-controller [options] <controller name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--no-prompt` | false | Do not ask for confirmation |
| `--t`, `--timeout` | 5m0s | Timeout before direct destruction |

## Details

Forcibly destroy the specified controller.  If the API server is accessible,
this command will attempt to destroy the controller model and all models
and their resources.

If the API server is unreachable, the machines of the controller model will be
destroyed through the cloud provisioner.  If there are additional machines,
including machines within models, these machines will not be destroyed
and will never be reconnected to the Juju controller being destroyed.

The normal process of killing the controller will involve watching the
models as they are brought down in a controlled manner. If for some reason the
models do not stop cleanly, there is a default five minute timeout. If no change
in the model state occurs for the duration of this timeout, the command will
stop watching and destroy the models directly through the cloud provider.

Clouds known to this client are the clouds known to Juju out of the box 
along with any which have been added with `add-cloud --client`. These clouds can be
used to create a controller and can be displayed using --client option.

Clouds may be listed that are co-hosted with the Juju client.  When the LXD hypervisor
is detected, the 'localhost' cloud is made available.  When a microk8s installation is
detected, the 'microk8s' cloud is displayed.

Use --controller option to list clouds from a controller. 
Use --client option to list clouds from this client. 
This command's default output format is 'tabular'. Use 'json' and 'yaml' for
machine-readable output.

Cloud metadata sometimes changes, e.g. providers add regions. Use the `update-public-clouds`
command to update public clouds or `update-cloud` to update other clouds.

Use the `regions` command to list a cloud's regions.

Use the `show-cloud` command to get more detail, such as regions and endpoints.

    juju credentials --controller mycontroller
    juju credentials --controller mycontroller --client


## Details
This command list credentials from this client and credentials
from a controller.

Locally stored credentials are client specific and 
are used with `juju bootstrap`  
and `juju add-model`. It's paramount to understand that
different client devices may have different locally stored credentials
for the same user.

Remotely stored credentials or controller stored credentials are
stored on the controller.

An arbitrary "credential name" is used to represent credentials, which are 
added either via `juju add-credential` or `juju autoload-credentials`.
Note that there can be multiple sets of credentials and, thus, multiple 
names.

Actual authentication material is exposed with the '--show-secrets' 
option in json or yaml formats. Secrets are not shown in tabular format.

A controller, and subsequently created models, can be created with a 
different set of credentials but any action taken within the model (e.g.:
`juju deploy`; `juju add-unit`) applies the credential used 
to create that model. This model credential is stored on the controller. 

A credential for 'controller' model is determined at bootstrap time and
will be stored on the controller. It is considered to be controller default.

Recall that when a controller is created a 'default' model is also 
created. This model will use the controller default credential. 
To see details of your credentials use "juju show-credential" command.

When adding a new model, Juju will reuse the controller default credential.
To add a model that uses a different credential, specify a  credential
from this client using --credential option. See `juju help add-model` 
for more information.

Credentials denoted with an asterisk '*' are currently set as the user default
for a given cloud.

Use --controller option to list credentials from a controller.

Use --client option to list credentials known locally on this client.

## Details

By default, the juju login command logs the user into a controller.
The argument to the command can be a public controller
host name or alias (see Aliases below).

If no argument is provided, the controller specified with
the -c argument will be used, or the current controller
if that's not provided.

On success, the current controller is switched to the logged-in
controller.

If the user is already logged in, the juju login command does nothing
except verify that fact.

If the -u option is provided, the juju login command will attempt to log
into the controller as that user.

After login, a token ("macaroon") will become active. It has an expiration
time of 24 hours. Upon expiration, no further Juju commands can be issued
and the user will be prompted to log in again.

Aliases
-------

Public controller aliases are provided by a directory service
that is queried to find the host name for a given alias.
The URL for the directory service may be configured
by setting the environment variable JUJU_DIRECTORY.

# LOGOUT
> See also: [change-user-password](#change-user-password), [login](#login)

## Summary
Logs a Juju user out of a controller.

| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--force` | false | Force logout when a locally recorded password is detected |

## Examples

    juju logout


## Details

If another client has logged in as the same user, they will remain logged
in. This command only affects the local client.

The command will fail if the user has not yet set a password
(`juju change-user-password`). This scenario is only possible after 
`juju bootstrap`since `juju register` sets a password. The
failing behaviour can be overridden with the '--force' option.

If the same user is logged in with another client system, that user session
will not be affected by this command; it only affects the local client.

By default, the controller is the current controller.

# MIGRATE
> See also: [login](#login), [controllers](#controllers), [status](#status)

## Summary
Migrate a workload model to another controller.

## Usage
```juju migrate [options] <model-name> <target-controller-name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |

## Details

migrate begins the migration of a model from its current controller to
a new controller. This is useful for load balancing when a controller
is too busy, or as a way to upgrade a model's controller to a newer
Juju version. Once complete, the model's machine and and unit agents
will be connected to the new controller. The model will no longer be
available at the source controller.

Note that only workload models can be migrated. Controller models can
not be migrated.

If the migration fails for some reason, the model be returned to its
original state with the model being managed by the original
controller.

In order to start a migration, the target controller must be in the
juju client's local configuration cache. See the juju "login" command
for details of how to do this.

This command only starts a model migration - it does not wait for its
completion. The progress of a migration can be tracked using the
"status" command and by consulting the logs.

# MODEL-CONFIG
> See also: [models](#models), [model-defaults](#model-defaults), [show-cloud](#show-cloud), [controller-config](#controller-config)

| `--no-color` | false | Disable ANSI color codes in tabular output |
| `--o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |
| `--reset` |  | Reset the provided comma delimited keys |

## Examples

Print the value of default-base:

    juju model-config default-base

Print the model config of model mycontroller:mymodel:

    juju model-config -m mycontroller:mymodel

Set the value of ftp-proxy to 10.0.0.1:8000:

    juju model-config ftp-proxy=10.0.0.1:8000

Set the model config to key=value pairs defined in a file:

    juju model-config --file path/to/file.yaml

Set model config values of a specific model:

    juju model-config -m othercontroller:mymodel default-base=ubuntu@22.04 test-mode=false

Reset the values of the provided keys to model defaults:

    juju model-config --reset default-base,test-mode


## Details

To view all configuration values for the current model, run
    juju model-config
You can target a specific model using the -m flag:
    juju model-config -m <model>
    juju model-config -m <controller>:<model>
By default, the config will be printed in a tabular format. You can instead
print it in json or yaml format using the --format flag:
    juju model-config --format json
    juju model-config --format yaml

To view the value of a single config key, run
    juju model-config key
To set config values, run
    juju model-config key1=val1 key2=val2 ...
You can also reset config keys to their default values:
    juju model-config --reset key1
    juju model-config --reset key1,key2,key3
You may simultaneously set some keys and reset others:
    juju model-config key1=val1 key2=val2 --reset key3,key4

Config values can be imported from a yaml file using the --file flag:
    juju model-config --file=path/to/cfg.yaml
This allows you to e.g. save a model's config to a file:
    juju model-config --format=yaml > cfg.yaml
and then import the config later. Note that the output of model-config
may include read-only values, which will cause an error when importing later.
To prevent the error, use the --ignore-read-only-fields flag:
    juju model-config --file=cfg.yaml --ignore-read-only-fields

You can also read from stdin using "-", which allows you to pipe config values
from one model to another:
    juju model-config -c c1 --format=yaml \
      | juju model-config -c c2 --file=- --ignore-read-only-fields
You can simultaneously read config from a yaml file and set config keys
as above. The command-line args will override any values specified in the file.

The default-series key is deprecated in favour of default-base
e.g. default-base=ubuntu@22.04.

# MODEL-CONSTRAINTS
> See also: [models](#models), [constraints](#constraints), [set-constraints](#set-constraints), [set-model-constraints](#set-model-constraints)

## Summary
Displays machine constraints for a model.

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--format` | constraints | Specify output format (constraints&#x7c;json&#x7c;yaml) |

By default, the model is the current model.
Model constraints are combined with constraints set on an application
with `juju set-constraints` for commands (such as 'deploy') that provision
machines/containers for applications. Where model and application constraints overlap, the
application constraints take precedence.
Constraints for a specific application can be viewed with `juju constraints`.

Set the value of ftp-proxy model config default to 10.0.0.1:8000 in the
us-east-1 region:

    juju model-defaults --region=us-east-1 ftp-proxy=10.0.0.1:8000

Set model default values for the aws cloud as defined in path/to/file.yaml:

    juju model-defaults --cloud=aws --file path/to/file.yaml

Reset the value of default-base and test-mode to default:

    juju model-defaults --reset default-base,test-mode

Reset the value of http-proxy for the us-east-1 region to default:

    juju model-defaults --region us-east-1 --reset http-proxy


## Details

To view all model default values for the current controller, run
    juju model-defaults
You can target a specific controller using the -c flag:
    juju model-defaults -c <controller>
By default, the output will be printed in a tabular format. You can instead
print it in json or yaml format using the --format flag:
    juju model-defaults --format json
    juju model-defaults --format yaml

To view the value of a single model default, run
    juju model-defaults key
To set default model config values, run
    juju model-defaults key1=val1 key2=val2 ...
You can also reset default keys to their original values:
    juju model-defaults --reset key1
    juju model-defaults --reset key1,key2,key3
You may simultaneously set some keys and reset others:
    juju model-defaults key1=val1 key2=val2 --reset key3,key4

Default values can be imported from a yaml file using the --file flag:
    juju model-defaults --file=path/to/cfg.yaml
This allows you to e.g. save a controller's model defaults to a file:
    juju model-defaults --format=yaml > cfg.yaml
and then import these later. Note that the output of model-defaults may
include read-only values, which will cause an error when importing later.
To prevent the error, use the --ignore-read-only-fields flag:
    juju model-defaults --file=cfg.yaml --ignore-read-only-fields

You can also read from stdin using "-", which allows you to pipe default model
values from one controller to another:
    juju model-defaults -c c1 --format=yaml \
      | juju model-defaults -c c2 --file=- --ignore-read-only-fields
You can simultaneously read config from a yaml file and set config keys
as above. The command-line args will override any values specified in the file.

Model default configuration settings are specific to the cloud on which the
model is deployed. If the controller hosts more than one cloud, the cloud
(and optionally region) must be specified using the --cloud flag. This flag
accepts arguments in the following forms:
    --cloud=<cloud>                    (specified cloud, all regions)
    --region=<region>               (default cloud, specified region)
    --region=<cloud>/<region>            (specified cloud and region)
    --cloud=<cloud> --region=<region>    (specified cloud and region)

# REFRESH

## Summary
Refresh an application's charm.

## Usage
```juju refresh [options] <application>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--bind` |  | Configure application endpoint bindings to spaces |
| `--channel` |  | Channel to use when getting the charm from Charmhub |
| `--config` |  | Either a path to yaml-formatted application config file or a key=value pair  |
| `--force` | false | Allow a charm to be refreshed which bypasses LXD profile allow list |
| `--force-series` | false | Refresh even if series of deployed applications are not supported by the new charm |
| `--force-units` | false | Refresh all units immediately, even if in error state |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |
| `--path` |  | Refresh to a charm located at path |
| `--resource` |  | Resource to be uploaded to the controller |
| `--revision` | -1 | Explicit revision of current charm |
| `--storage` |  | Charm storage constraints |
| `--switch` |  | Crossgrade to a different charm |
| `--trust` | unset | Allows charm to run hooks that require access credentials |

## Details

When no options are set, the application's charm will be refreshed to the latest
revision available in the repository from which it was originally deployed. An
explicit revision can be chosen with the --revision option.

A path will need to be supplied to allow an updated copy of the charm
to be located.

Deploying from a path is intended to suit the workflow of a charm author working
on a single client machine; use of this deployment method from multiple clients
is not supported and may lead to confusing behaviour. Each local charm gets
uploaded with the revision specified in the charm, if possible, otherwise it
gets a unique revision (highest in state + 1).

When deploying from a path, the --path option is used to specify the location from
which to load the updated charm. Note that the directory containing the charm must
match what was originally used to deploy the charm as a superficial check that the
updated charm is compatible.

Resources may be uploaded at upgrade time by specifying the --resource option.
Following the resource option should be name=filepath pair.  This option may be
repeated more than once to upload more than one resource.

  juju refresh foo --resource bar=/some/file.tgz --resource baz=./docs/cfg.xml

Where bar and baz are resources named in the metadata for the foo charm.

Storage constraints may be added or updated at upgrade time by specifying
the --storage option, with the same format as specified in "juju deploy".
If new required storage is added by the new charm revision, then you must
specify constraints or the defaults will be applied.

  juju refresh foo --storage cache=ssd,10G

Charm settings may be added or updated at upgrade time by specifying the
--config option, pointing to a YAML-encoded application config file.

  juju refresh foo --config config.yaml

If the new version of a charm does not explicitly support the application's series, the
upgrade is disallowed unless the --force-series option is used. This option should be
used with caution since using a charm on a machine running an unsupported series may
cause unexpected behavior.

The --switch option allows you to replace the charm with an entirely different one.
The new charm's URL and revision are inferred as they would be when running a
deploy command.

Please note that --switch is dangerous, because juju only has limited
information with which to determine compatibility; the operation will succeed,
regardless of potential havoc, so long as the following conditions hold:

- The new charm must declare all relations that the application is currently
  participating in.
- All config settings shared by the old and new charms must
  have the same types.

The new charm may add new relations and configuration settings.

The new charm may also need to be granted access to trusted credentials.
Use --trust to grant such access.
Or use --trust=false to revoke such access.

--switch and --path are mutually exclusive.

--path and --revision are mutually exclusive. The revision of the updated charm
is determined by the contents of the charm at the specified path.

--switch and --revision are mutually exclusive.

Use of the --force-units option is not generally recommended; units upgraded
while in an error state will not have refreshed hooks executed, and may cause
unexpected behavior.

--force option for LXD Profiles is not generally recommended when upgrading an
application; overriding profiles on the container may cause unexpected
behavior.

# REGISTER
> See also: [add-user](#add-user), [change-user-password](#change-user-password), [unregister](#unregister)

## Summary
Registers a controller.

## Usage
```juju register [options] <registration string>|<controller host name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--replace` | false | replace any existing controller |

## Examples

    juju register MFATA3JvZDAnExMxMDQuMTU0LjQyLjQ0OjE3MDcwExAxMC4xMjguMC4yOjE3MDcwBCBEFCaXerhNImkKKabuX5ULWf2Bp4AzPNJEbXVWgraLrAA=

    juju register public-controller.example.com


## Details

The register command adds details of a controller to the local system.
This is done either by completing the user registration process that
began with the 'juju add-user' command, or by providing the DNS host
name of a public controller.

To complete the user registration process, you should have been provided
with a base64-encoded blob of data (the output of 'juju add-user')
which can be copied and pasted as the &lt;string&gt; argument to 'register'.
You will be prompted for a password, which, once set, causes the
registration string to be voided. In order to start using Juju the user
can now either add a model or wait for a model to be shared with them.
Some machine providers will require the user to be in possession of
certain credentials in order to add a model.

If a new controller has been spun up to replace an existing one, and you want 
to start using that replacement controller instead of the original one,
use the --replace option to overwrite any existing controller details based
on either a name or UUID match.

When adding a controller at a public address, authentication via some
external third party (for example Ubuntu SSO) will be required, usually
by using a web browser.

```juju integrate [options] <application>[:<relation>] <application>[:<relation>]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

Integrate wordpress and percona-cluster, asking Juju to resolve
 the endpoint names. Expands to "wordpress:db" (with the requires role) and
 "percona-cluster:server" (with the provides role).

    juju integrate wordpress percona-cluster

Integrate wordpress and postgresql, using an explicit
endpoint name.

    juju integrate wordpress postgresql:db

Integrate an etcd instance within the current model to centrally managed
EasyRSA Certificate Authority hosted in the "secrets" model.

    juju integrate etcd secrets.easyrsa

Integrate a wordpress application with a mysql application hosted within the
"prod" model, using the "automation" user. Facilitate firewall management
by specifying the routes used for integration data.

    juju integrate wordpress automation/prod.mysql --via 192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8


## Details

Integrate two applications. Integrated applications communicate over a common
interface provided by the Juju controller that enables units to share information.
This topology allows units to share data, without needing direct connectivity
between units is restricted by firewall rules. Charms define the logic for
transferring and interpreting integration data.

The most common use of 'juju integrate' specifies two applications that co-exist
within the same model:

    juju integrate <application> <application>

Occasionally, more explicit syntax is required. Juju is able to integrate
units that span models, controllers and clouds, as described below.


Integrating applications in the same model

The most common case specifies two applications, adding specific endpoint
name(s) when required.

    juju integrate <application>[:<endpoint>] <application>[:<endpoint>]

The role and endpoint names are described by charms' metadata.yaml file.

The order does not matter, however each side must implement complementary roles.
One side implements the "provides" role and the other implements the "requires"
role. Juju can always infer the role that each side is implementing, so specifying
them is not necessary as command-line arguments.

&lt;application&gt; is the name of an application that has already been added to the
model. The Applications section of 'juju status' provides a list of current
applications.

&lt;endpoint&gt; is the name of an endpoint defined within the metadata.yaml
of the charm for &lt;application&gt;. Valid endpoint names are defined within the
"provides:" and "requires:" section of that file. Juju will request that you
specify the &lt;endpoint&gt; if there is more than one possible integration between
the two applications.


Subordinate applications

Subordinate applications are designed to be deployed alongside a primary
application. They must define a container scoped endpoint. When that endpoint
is related to a primary application, wherever a unit of the primary application
is deployed, a corresponding unit of the subordinate application will also be
deployed. Integration with the primary application has the same syntax as
integration any two applications within the same model.


Peer integrations

Integrations within an application between units (known as "peer integrations") do
not need to be added manually. They are created when the 'juju add-unit' and
'juju scale-application' commands are executed.


Cross-model integrations

Applications can be integrated, even when they are deployed to different models.
Those models may be managed by different controllers and/or be hosted on
different clouds. This functionality is known as "cross-model integration" or CMI.


Cross-model integrations: different model on the same controller

Integrating applications in models managed by the same controller
is very similar to adding an integration between applications in the same model:

    juju integrate <application>[:<endpoint>] <model>.<application>[:<endpoint>]

&lt;model&gt; is the name of the model outside of the current context. This enables the
Juju controller to bridge two models. You can list the currently available
models with 'juju models'.

To integrate models outside of the current context, add the '-m &lt;model&gt;' option:

    juju integrate -m <model> <application>[:<endpoint>] \
                     <model>.<application>[:<endpoint>]


Cross-model integrations: different controllers

Applications can be integrated with a remote application via an "offer URL" that has
been generated by the 'juju offer' command. The syntax for adding a cross-model
integration is similar to adding a local integration:

    juju integrate <application>[:<endpoint>] <offer-endpoint>

&lt;offer-endpoint&gt; describes the remote application, from the point of view of the
local one. An &lt;offer-endpoint&gt; takes one of two forms:

    <offer-alias>
    <offer-url>[:<endpoint>]

&lt;offer-alias&gt; is an alias that has been defined by the 'juju consume' command.
Use the 'juju find-offers' command to list aliases.

&lt;offer-url&gt; is a path to enable Juju to resolve communication between
controllers and the models they control.

    [[<controller>:]<user>/]<model-name>.<application-name>

&lt;controller&gt; is the name of a controller. The 'juju controllers' command
provides a list of controllers.

&lt;user&gt; is the user account of the model's owner.


Cross-model integration: network management

When the consuming side (the local application) is behind a firewall and/or
NAT is used for outbound traffic, it is possible to use the '--via' option to
inform the offering side (the remote application) the source of traffic to
enable network ports to be opened.

    ... --via <cidr-subnet>[,<cidr-subnet>[, ...]]

# REMOVE-APPLICATION

## Summary
Remove applications from the model.

## Usage
```juju remove-application [options] <application> [<application>...]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--destroy-storage` | false | Destroy storage attached to application units |
| `--dry-run` | false | Print what this command would remove without removing |
| `--force` | false | Completely remove an application and all its dependencies |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |
| `--no-prompt` | false | Do not ask for confirmation. Overrides `mode` model config setting |
| `--no-wait` | false | Rush through application removal without waiting for each individual step to complete |

## Examples

    juju remove-application hadoop
    juju remove-application --force hadoop
    juju remove-application --force --no-wait hadoop
    juju remove-application -m test-model mariadb


## Details
Removing an application will terminate any relations that application has, remove
all units of the application, and in the case that this leaves machines with
no running applications, Juju will also remove the machine. For this reason,
you should retrieve any logs or data required from applications and units 
before removing them. Removing units which are co-located with units of
other charms or a Juju controller will not result in the removal of the
machine.

Sometimes, the removal of the application may fail as Juju encounters errors
and failures that need to be dealt with before an application can be removed.
For example, Juju will not remove an application if there are hook failures.
However, at times, there is a need to remove an application ignoring
all operational errors. In these rare cases, use --force option but note 
that --force will also remove all units of the application, its subordinates
and, potentially, machines without given them the opportunity to shutdown cleanly.

Application removal is a multi-step process. Under normal circumstances, Juju will not
proceed to the next step until the current step has finished. 
However, when using --force, users can also specify --no-wait to progress through steps 
without delay waiting for each step to complete.

# REMOVE-CREDENTIAL
> See also: [add-credential](#add-credential), [autoload-credentials](#autoload-credentials), [credentials](#credentials), [default-credential](#default-credential), [set-credential](#set-credential), [update-credential](#update-credential)

## Summary
Removes Juju credentials for a cloud.

## Usage
```juju remove-credential [options] <cloud name> <credential name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |

    juju remove-credential google credential_name -c mycontroller
    juju remove-credential google credential_name -c mycontroller --force



## Details
The credential to be removed is specified by a "credential name".
Credential names, and optionally the corresponding authentication
material, can be listed with `juju credentials`.

Use --controller option to remove credentials from a controller. 

When removing cloud credential from a controller, Juju performs additional
checks to ensure that there are no models using this credential.
Occasionally, these check may not be desired by the user and can be by-passed using --force. 
If force remove was performed and some models were still using the credential, these models 
will be left with un-reachable machines.
Consequently, it is not recommended as a default remove action.
Models with un-reachable machines are most commonly fixed by using another cloud credential, 
see ' + "'juju set-credential'" + ' for more information.


Use --client option to remove credentials from the current client.

output of `juju status`.

It is possible to remove machine from Juju model without affecting
the corresponding cloud instance by using --keep-instance option.

Machines responsible for the model cannot be removed.

Machines running units or containers can be removed using the '--force'
option; this will also remove those units and containers without giving
them an opportunity to shut down cleanly.

Machine removal is a multi-step process. Under normal circumstances, Juju will not
proceed to the next step until the current step has finished.

# REMOVE-RELATION
> See also: [integrate](#integrate), [remove-application](#remove-application)

## Summary
Removes an existing relation between two applications.

## Usage
```juju remove-relation [options] <application1>[:<relation name1>] <application2>[:<relation name2>] | <relation-id>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--force` | false | Force remove a relation |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

    juju remove-relation mysql wordpress
    juju remove-relation 4
    juju remove-relation 4 --force

In the case of multiple relations, the relation name should be specified
at least once - the following examples will all have the same effect:

    juju remove-relation mediawiki:db mariadb:db
    juju remove-relation mediawiki mariadb:db
    juju remove-relation mediawiki:db mariadb


## Details
An existing relation between the two specified applications will be removed. 
This should not result in either of the applications entering an error state,
but may result in either or both of the applications being unable to continue
normal operation. In the case that there is more than one relation between
two applications it is necessary to specify which is to be removed (see
examples). Relations will automatically be removed when using the`juju
remove-application` command.

The relation is specified using the relation endpoint names, eg
  mysql wordpress, or
  mediawiki:db mariadb:db

It is also possible to specify the relation ID, if known. This is useful to
terminate a relation originating from a different model, where only the ID is known. 

Sometimes, the removal of the relation may fail as Juju encounters errors
and failures that need to be dealt with before a relation can be removed.
However, at times, there is a need to remove a relation ignoring
all operational errors. In these rare cases, use --force option but note 
that --force will remove a relation without giving it the opportunity to be removed cleanly.

    juju remove-unit wordpress/2 --destroy-storage

    juju remove-unit wordpress/2 --force

    juju remove-unit wordpress/2 --force --no-wait


## Details

Remove application units from the model.

The usage of this command differs depending on whether it is being used on a
k8s or cloud model.

Removing all units of a application is not equivalent to removing the
application itself; for that, the `juju remove-application` command
is used.

For k8s models only a single application can be supplied and only the
--num-units argument supported.
Specific units cannot be targeted for removal as that is handled by k8s,
instead the total number of units to be removed is specified.

Examples:
    juju remove-unit wordpress --num-units 2

For cloud models specific units can be targeted for removal.
Units of a application are numbered in sequence upon creation. For example, the
fourth unit of wordpress will be designated "wordpress/3". These identifiers
can be supplied in a space delimited list to remove unwanted units from the
model.

Juju will also remove the machine if the removed unit was the only unit left
on that machine (including units in containers).

Sometimes, the removal of the unit may fail as Juju encounters errors
and failures that need to be dealt with before a unit can be removed.
For example, Juju will not remove a unit if there are hook failures.
However, at times, there is a need to remove a unit ignoring
all operational errors. In these rare cases, use --force option but note
that --force will remove a unit and, potentially, its machine without
given them the opportunity to shutdown cleanly.

Unit removal is a multi-step process. Under normal circumstances, Juju will not
proceed to the next step until the current step has finished.
However, when using --force, users can also specify --no-wait to progress through steps
without delay waiting for each step to complete.

Revoke 'write' access from user 'sam' for models 'model1' and 'model2':

    juju revoke sam write model1 model2

Revoke 'read' (and 'write') access from user 'joe' for application offer 'fred/prod.hosted-mysql':

    juju revoke joe read fred/prod.hosted-mysql

Revoke 'consume' access from user 'sam' for models 'fred/prod.hosted-mysql' and 'mary/test.hosted-mysql':

    juju revoke sam consume fred/prod.hosted-mysql mary/test.hosted-mysql


## Details
By default, the controller is the current controller.

Revoking write access, from a user who has that permission, will leave
that user with read access. Revoking read access, however, also revokes
write access.

Valid access levels for models are:
    read
    write
    admin

Valid access levels for controllers are:
    login
    superuser

Valid access levels for application offers are:
    read
    consume
    admin

## Examples

    juju run mysql/3 backup --background
    juju run mysql/3 backup --wait=2m
    juju run mysql/3 backup --format yaml
    juju run mysql/3 backup --utc
    juju run mysql/3 backup
    juju run mysql/leader backup
    juju show-operation <ID>
    juju run mysql/3 backup --params parameters.yml
    juju run mysql/3 backup out=out.tar.bz2 file.kind=xz file.quality=high
    juju run mysql/3 backup --params p.yml file.kind=xz file.quality=high
    juju run sleeper/0 pause time=1000
    juju run sleeper/0 pause --string-args time=1000


## Details

Run a charm action for execution on the given unit(s), with a given set of params.
An ID is returned for use with 'juju show-operation &lt;ID&gt;'.

A action executed on a given unit becomes a task with an ID that can be
used with 'juju show-task &lt;ID&gt;'.

Running an action returns the overall operation ID as well as the individual
task ID(s) for each unit.

To queue a action to be run in the background without waiting for it to finish,
use the --background option.

To set the maximum time to wait for a action to complete, use the --wait option.

By default, the output of a single action will just be that action's stdout.
For multiple actions, each action stdout is printed with the action id.
To see more detailed information about run timings etc, use --format yaml.

Valid unit identifiers are: 
  a standard unit ID, such as mysql/0 or;
  leader syntax of the form &lt;application&gt;/leader, such as mysql/leader.

If the leader syntax is used, the leader unit for the application will be
resolved before the action is enqueued.

Params are validated according to the charm for the unit's application.  The
valid params can be seen using "juju actions &lt;application&gt; --schema".
Params may be in a yaml file which is passed with the --params option, or they
may be specified by a key.key.key...=value format (see examples below.)

Params given in the CLI invocation will be parsed as YAML unless the
--string-args option is set.  This can be helpful for values such as 'y', which
is a boolean true in YAML.

If --params is passed, along with key.key...=value explicit arguments, the
explicit arguments will override the parameter file.

    juju scp -- -3 0:file.dat foo/0:

Copy a file ('chunks-inspect') from localhost to /loki directory
in a specific container in a juju unit running in Kubernetes:

    juju scp --container loki chunks-inspect loki-k8s/0:/loki


## Details

Transfer files to, from and between Juju machine(s), unit(s) and the 
Juju client.

The basic syntax for the command requires the location of 1 or more source 
files or directories and their intended destination:

    <source> <destination>

The &lt;source&gt; and &lt;destination&gt; arguments may either be a path to a local file
or a remote location. Here is a fuller syntax diagram:

    # <source>                 <destination>
    [[<user>@]<target>:]<path> [<user>@]<target>:[<path>]

&lt;user&gt; is a user account that exists on the remote host. Juju defaults to the 
"ubuntu" user when this is omitted.

&lt;target&gt; may be either a unit or machine. Units are specified in form
'&lt;application-name&gt;/&lt;n&gt;', where '&lt;n&gt;' is either the unit number or the value
"leader" when targeting the leader unit for an application e.g. postgresql/0 or
haproxy/leader. Machines are specified in form '&lt;n&gt;', e.g. 0 or 12. The units
and machines in your model can be obtained from the output of "juju status".

&lt;path&gt; is a file path. Local relative paths are resolved relative to the 
current working directory. Remote relative paths are resolved relative to the
home directory of the remote user account. 


Providing arguments directly to scp

Send arguments directly to the underlying scp utility for full control by
adding two hyphens to the argument list and adding arguments to the right
(-- &lt;arg&gt; [...]). Common arguments to scp include

 - "-r" recursively copy files from a directory
 - "-3" use the client as a proxy for transfers between machines
 - "-C" enable SSH compression


Transfers between machines

Machines do not have SSH connectivity to each other by default. Within a Juju
model, all communication is facilitated by the Juju controller. To transfer
files between machines, you can use the -3 option to scp, e.g. add "-- -3"
to the command-line arguments.


Security considerations

To enable transfers to/from machines that do not have internet access, you can use
the Juju controller as a proxy with the --proxy option.  

The SSH host keys of the target are verified by default. To disable this, add
 --no-host-key-checks option. Using this option is strongly discouraged.

# SET-APPLICATION-BASE
> See also: [status](#status), [refresh](#refresh), [upgrade-machine](#upgrade-machine)

## Summary
Set an application's base.

## Usage
```juju set-application-base [options] <application> <base>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

Set the base for the ubuntu application to ubuntu@20.04:

	juju set-application-base ubuntu ubuntu@20.04


## Details

The specified application's base value will be set within juju. Any subordinates 
of the application will also have their base set to the provided value. A base 
can be specified using the OS name and the version of the OS, separated by @.

This will not change the base of any existing units, rather new units will use
the new base when deployed.

It is recommended to only do this after upgrade-machine has been run for 
machine containing all existing units of the application.

To ensure correct binaries, run 'juju refresh' before running 'juju add-unit'.

# SET-CONSTRAINTS
> See also: [constraints](#constraints), [model-constraints](#model-constraints), [set-model-constraints](#set-model-constraints)

## Summary
Sets machine constraints for an application.

## Usage
```juju set-constraints [options] <application> <constraint>=<value> ...```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |

## Details
Sets constraints for an application, which are used for all new machines 
provisioned for that application. They can be viewed with `juju constraints`.
By default, the model is the current model.
Application constraints are combined with model constraints, set with `juju 
set-model-constraints`, for commands (such as 'juju deploy') that 
provision machines for applications. Where model and application constraints
overlap, the application constraints take precedence.
Constraints for a specific model can be viewed with `juju model-constraints`.
This command requires that the application to have at least one unit. To apply 
constraints to
the first unit set them at the model level or pass them as an argument
when deploying.

# SET-CREDENTIAL
> See also: [credentials](#credentials), [show-credential](#show-credential), [update-credential](#update-credential)

## Summary
Relates a remote credential to a model.

## Usage
```juju set-credential [options] <cloud name> <credential name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

For cloud 'aws', relate remote credential 'bob' to model 'trinity':

    juju set-credential -m trinity aws bob


## Details

This command relates a credential cached on a controller to a specific model.
It does not change/update the contents of an existing active credential. See
command `update-credential` for that.

The credential specified may exist locally (on the client), remotely (on the
controller), or both. The command will error out if the credential is stored
neither remotely nor locally.

When remote, the credential will be related to the specified model.

When local and not remote, the credential will first be uploaded to the
controller and then related.

This command does not affect an existing relation between the specified
credential and another model. If the credential is already related to a model
this operation will result in that credential being related to two models.

Use the `show-credential` command to see how remote credentials are related
to models.

via `juju add-credential` or `juju autoload-credentials`. 
Credential names can be listed with `juju credentials`.

This command sets a locally stored credential to be used as a default.
Default credentials avoid the need to specify a particular set of 
credentials when more than one are available for a given cloud.

To unset previously set default credential for a cloud, use --reset option.

To view currently set default credential for a cloud, use the command
without a credential name argument.

| `--remote` | false | Target on the workload or operator pod (k8s-only) |

## Examples

Connect to machine 0:

    juju ssh 0

Connect to machine 1 and run command 'uname -a':

    juju ssh 1 uname -a

Connect to the leader mysql unit:

    juju ssh mysql/leader

Connect to a specific mysql unit:

    juju ssh mysql/0

Connect to a jenkins unit as user jenkins:

    juju ssh jenkins@jenkins/0

Connect to a mysql unit with an identity not known to juju (ssh option -i):

    juju ssh mysql/0 -i ~/.ssh/my_private_key echo hello

**For k8s charms running the workload in a separate pod:**

Connect to a k8s unit targeting the operator pod by default:

	juju ssh mysql/0
	juju ssh mysql/0 bash
	
Connect to a k8s unit targeting the workload pod by specifying --remote:

	juju ssh --remote mysql/0

**For k8s charms using the sidecar pattern:**

Connect to a k8s unit targeting the charm container (the default):

	juju ssh --container charm snappass/0

Connect to a k8s unit targeting the redis container:

	juju ssh --container redis snappass/0

**For k8s controller:**

Connect to the api server pod:

    juju ssh --container api-server 0

Connect to the mongo db pod:

    juju ssh --container mongodb 0


## Details

The ssh target is identified by the &lt;target&gt; argument which is either a 'unit
name' or a 'machine id'. Both can be obtained by examining the output to "juju
status".

Valid unit identifiers are:
  a standard unit ID, such as mysql/0 or;
  leader syntax of the form &lt;application&gt;/leader, such as mysql/leader.

If 'user' is specified then the connection is made to that user
account; otherwise, the default 'ubuntu' account, created by Juju, is used.

The optional command is executed on the remote machine, and any output is sent
back to the user. If no command is specified, then an interactive shell session
will be initiated.

When "juju ssh" is executed without a terminal attached, e.g. when piping the
output of another command into it, then the default behavior is to not allocate
a pseudo-terminal (pty) for the ssh session; otherwise a pty is allocated. This
behavior can be overridden by explicitly specifying the behavior with
"--pty=true" or "--pty=false".

The SSH host keys of the target are verified. The --no-host-key-checks option
can be used to disable these checks. Use of this option is not recommended as
it opens up the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.

The default identity known to Juju and used by this command is ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Options can be passed to the local OpenSSH client (ssh) on platforms 
where it is available. This is done by inserting them between the target and 
a possible remote command. Refer to the ssh man page for an explanation 
of those options.

For k8s charms, the --container argument is used to identity a specific
container in the pod. For charms which run the workload in a separate pod
to that of the charm, the default ssh target is the charm operator pod.
The workload pod may be specified using the --remote argument.

## Details
Juju maintains a per-model cache of SSH keys which it copies to each newly
created unit.
This command will display a list of all the keys currently used by Juju in
the current model (or the model specified, if the '-m' option is used).
By default a minimal list is returned, showing only the fingerprint of
each key and its text identifier. By using the '--full' option, the entire
key may be displayed.

# SWITCH
> See also: [controllers](#controllers), [models](#models), [show-controller](#show-controller)

## Summary
Selects or identifies the current controller and model.

## Usage
```juju switch [options] [<controller>|<model>|<controller>:|:<model>|<controller>:<model>]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |

## Examples

    juju switch
    juju switch mymodel
    juju switch mycontroller
    juju switch mycontroller:mymodel
    juju switch mycontroller:
    juju switch :mymodel


## Details
When used without an argument, the command shows the current controller
and its active model.
When a single argument without a colon is provided juju first looks for a
controller by that name and switches to it, and if it's not found it tries
to switch to a model within current controller. mycontroller: switches to
default model in mycontroller, :mymodel switches to mymodel in current
controller and mycontroller:mymodel switches to mymodel on mycontroller.
The `juju models` command can be used to determine the active model
(of any controller). An asterisk denotes it.

| `--public` | false | Tools are for a public cloud, so generate mirrors information |
| `--source` |  | Local source directory |
| `--stream` |  | Simplestreams stream for which to sync metadata |

## Examples

    juju sync-agent-binary --debug --agent-version 2.0
    juju sync-agent-binary --debug --agent-version 2.0 --local-dir=/home/ubuntu/sync-agent-binary


## Details

This copies the Juju agent software from the official agent binaries store 
(located at https://streams.canonical.com/juju) into the controller.
It is generally done when the controller is without Internet access.

Instead of the above site, a local directory can be specified as source.
The online store will, of course, need to be contacted at some point to get
the software.

## Examples

    juju trust media-wiki
    juju trust metallb --scope=cluster


## Details
Sets the trust configuration value to true.

On k8s models, the trust operation currently grants the charm full access to the cluster.
Until the permissions model is refined to grant more granular role based access, the use of
'--scope=cluster' is required to confirm this choice.

# UNEXPOSE

## Summary
Removes public availability over the network for an application.

## Usage
```juju unexpose [options] <application name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--endpoints` |  | Unexpose only the ports that charms have opened for this comma-delimited list of endpoints |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Details
Adjusts the firewall rules and any relevant security mechanisms of the
cloud to deny public access to the application.

Applications are unexposed by default when they get created. If exposed via
the "juju expose" command, they can be unexposed by running the "juju unexpose"
command.  

If no additional options are specified, the command will unexpose the
application (if exposed). For example, to unexpose the apache2 application,
you can run:

juju unexpose apache2

The --endpoints option may be used to restrict the effect of this command to 
the list of ports opened for a comma-delimited list of endpoints. For instance,
to only unexpose the ports opened by apache2 for the "www" endpoint, you can 
run:

juju unexpose apache2 --endpoints www

Note that when the --endpoints option is provided, the application will still
remain exposed if any other of its endpoints are still exposed. However, if
none of its endpoints remain exposed, the application will be instead unexposed.

## Examples

    juju unregister my-controller


## Details

Removes local connection information for the specified controller.  This
command does not destroy the controller.  In order to regain access to an
unregistered controller, it will need to be added again using the juju register
command.

    juju update-cloud mymaas --client --controller mycontroller
    juju update-cloud mymaas --client -f path/to/maas.yaml


## Details

Update cloud information on this client and/or on a controller.

A cloud can be updated from a file. This requires a &lt;cloud name&gt; and a yaml file
containing the cloud details. 
This method can be used for cloud updates on the client side and on a controller. 

A cloud on the controller can also be updated just by using a name of a cloud
from this client.

Use --controller option to update a cloud on a controller. 

Use --client to update cloud definition on this client.

# UPDATE-CREDENTIAL
> See also: [add-credential](#add-credential), [credentials](#credentials), [remove-credential](#remove-credential), [set-credential](#set-credential)

## Summary
Updates a controller credential for a cloud.

## Usage
```juju update-credential [options] [<cloud-name> [<credential-name>]]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--client` | false | Client operation |
| `--f`, `--file` |  | The YAML file containing credential details to update |
| `--force` | false | Force update controller side credential, ignore validation errors |
| `--region` |  | Cloud region that credential is valid for |

## Examples

    juju update-credential aws mysecrets
    juju update-credential -f mine.yaml
    juju update-credential -f mine.yaml --client
    juju update-credential aws -f mine.yaml
    juju update-credential azure --region brazilsouth -f mine.yaml
    juju update-credential -f mine.yaml --controller mycontroller --force


## Details
Cloud credentials are used for model operations and manipulations.
Since it is common to have long-running models, it is also common to 
have these cloud credentials become invalid during models' lifetime.
When this happens, a user must update the cloud credential that 
a model was created with to the new and valid details on controller.

This command allows to update an existing, already-stored, named,
cloud-specific credential on a controller as well as the one from this client.

Use --controller option to update a credential definition on a controller. 

When updating cloud credential on a controller, Juju performs additional
checks to ensure that the models that use this credential can still
access cloud instances after the update. Occasionally, these checks may not be desired
by the user and can be by-passed using --force option. 
Force update may leave some models with un-reachable machines.
Consequently, it is not recommended as a default update action.
Models with un-reachable machines are most commonly fixed by using another cloud credential, 
see ' + "'juju set-credential'" + ' for more information.

Use --client to update a credential definition on this client.
If a user will use a different client, say a different laptop, 
the update will not affect that client's (laptop's) copy.

Before credential is updated, the new content is validated. For some providers, 
cloud credentials are region specific. To validate the credential for a non-default region, 
use --region.

version`.
A version is denoted by: major.minor.patch

You can upgrade the controller to a new patch version by specifying
the '--agent-version' flag. If not specified, the upgrade candidate
will default to the most recent patch version matching the current 
major and minor version. Upgrading to a new major or minor version is
not supported.

The command will abort if an upgrade is in progress. It will also abort if
a previous upgrade was not fully completed (e.g.: if one of the

## Summary
Upgrade the Ubuntu base of a machine.

## Usage
```juju upgrade-machine [options] <machine> <command> [args]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `--force` | false | Upgrade even if the base is not supported by the charm and/or related subordinate charms. |
| `--m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |
| `--y`, `--yes` | false | Agree that the operation cannot be reverted or canceled once started without being prompted. |

## Examples

Prepare machine 3 for upgrade to base "ubuntu@18.04"":

	juju upgrade-machine 3 prepare ubuntu@18.04

Prepare machine 4 for upgrade to base "ubuntu@20.04" even if there are 
applications running units that do not support the target base:

	juju upgrade-machine 4 prepare ubuntu@20.04 --force

Complete upgrade of machine 5, indicating that all automatic and any
necessary manual upgrade steps have completed successfully:

	juju upgrade-machine 5 complete


## Details

Upgrade a machine's operating system release.

upgrade-machine allows users to perform a managed upgrade of the operating system
release of a machine using a base. This command is performed in two steps; 
prepare and complete.

The "prepare" step notifies Juju that a base upgrade is taking place for a given
machine and as such Juju guards that machine against operations that would
interfere with the upgrade process. A base can be specified using the OS name
and the version of the OS, separated by @.

The "complete" step notifies juju that the managed upgrade has been successfully 
completed.

It should be noted that once the prepare command is issued there is no way to
cancel or abort the process. Once you commit to prepare you must complete the
process or you will end up with an unusable machine!

The requested base must be explicitly supported by all charms deployed to
the specified machine. To override this constraint the --force option may be used.

The --force option should be used with caution since using a charm on a machine
running an unsupported base may cause unexpected behavior. Alternately, if the
requested base is supported in later revisions of the charm, upgrade-charm can
run beforehand.

## Examples

    juju upgrade-model --dry-run
    juju upgrade-model --agent-version 2.0.1
    juju upgrade-model --agent-stream proposed


## Details
Juju provides agent software to every machine it creates. This command
upgrades that software across an entire model, which is, by default, the
current model.
A model's agent version can be shown with `juju model-config agent-
version`.
A version is denoted by: major.minor.patch

If '--agent-version' is not specified, then the upgrade candidate is
selected to be the exact version the controller itself is running.

If the controller is without internet access, the client must first supply
the software to the controller's cache via the `juju sync-agent-binary` command.
The command will abort if an upgrade is in progress. It will also abort if
a previous upgrade was not fully completed (e.g.: if one of the
controllers in a high availability model failed to upgrade).

When looking for an agent to upgrade to Juju will check the currently
configured agent stream for that model. It's possible to overwrite this for
the lifetime of this upgrade using --agent-stream

If a failed upgrade has been resolved, '--reset-previous-upgrade' can be
used to allow the upgrade to proceed.
Backups are recommended prior to upgrading.
